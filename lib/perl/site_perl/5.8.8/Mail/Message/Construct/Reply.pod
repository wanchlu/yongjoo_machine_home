=head1 NAME

Mail::Message::Construct::Reply - reply to a Mail::Message

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my Mail::Message $reply = $message->reply;
 my $quoted  = $message->replyPrelude($head->get('From'));

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Complex functionality on L<Mail::Message|Mail::Message> objects is implemented in
different files which are autoloaded.  This file implements the
functionality related to creating message replies.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructing a message

$obj-E<gt>B<reply>(OPTIONS)

=over 4

Start a reply to this message. Some of the header-lines of the original
message will be taken. A message-id will be assigned. Some header lines
will be updated to facilitate message-thread detection
(see L<Mail::Box::Thread::Manager|Mail::Box::Thread::Manager>).

You may reply to a whole message or a message part.  You may wish to
overrule some of the default header settings for the reply immediately,
or you may do that later with C<set> on the header.

ADDRESSES may be specified as string, or
a L<Mail::Address|Mail::Address> object, or as array of L<Mail::Address|Mail::Address> objects.

All OPTIONS which are not listed below AND start with a capital, will
be added as additional headers to the reply message.

 Option         --Default
 Bcc              undef
 Cc               <'cc' in current>
 From             <'to' in current>
 Message-ID       <uniquely generated>
 Subject          replySubject()
 To               <sender in current>
 body             undef
 group_reply      <true>
 include          'INLINE'
 max_signature    10
 message_type     Mail::Message
 postlude         undef
 prelude          undef
 quote            '> '
 signature        undef
 strip_signature  qr/^--\s/

. Bcc => ADDRESSES

=over 4

Receivers of blind carbon copies: their names will not be published to
other message receivers.

=back

. Cc => ADDRESSES

=over 4

The carbon-copy receivers, by default a copy of the C<Cc> field of
the source message.

=back

. From => ADDRESSES

=over 4

Your identification, by default taken from the C<To> field of the
source message.

=back

. Message-ID => STRING

=over 4

Supply a STRING as specific message-id for the reply.  By default, one is
generated for you.  If there are no angles around your id, they will be
added.

=back

. Subject => STRING|CODE

=over 4

Force the subject line to the specific STRING, or the result of the
subroutine specified by CODE.  The subroutine will be called passing
the subject of the original message as only argument.  By default,
L<Mail::Message::replySubject()|Mail::Message::Construct::Reply/"Constructing a message"> is used.

=back

. To => ADDRESSES

=over 4

The destination of your message.  By default taken from the C<Reply-To>
field in the source message.  If that field is not present as well, the
C<From> line is scanned.  If they all fail, C<undef> is returned by this
method: no reply message produced.

=back

. body => BODY

=over 4

Usually, the reply method can create a nice, sufficient message from the
source message's body.  In case you like more complicated reformatting,
you may also create a body yourself first, and pass this on to this
C<reply> method. Some of the other options to this method will be ingored
in this case.

=back

. group_reply => BOOLEAN

=over 4

Will the people listed in the C<Cc> headers (those who received the
message where you reply to now) also receive this message as carbon
copy?

=back

. include => 'NO'|'INLINE'|'ATTACH'

=over 4

Must the message where this is a reply to be included in the message?
If C<NO> then not.  With C<INLINE> a reply body is composed. C<ATTACH>
will create a multi-part body, where the original message is added
after the specified body.  It is only possible to inline textual
messages, therefore binary or multipart messages will always be
enclosed as attachment.

=back

. max_signature => INTEGER

=over 4

Passed to C<stripSignature> on the body as parameter C<max_lines>.  Only
effective for single-part messages.

=back

. message_type => CLASS

=over 4

Create a message with the requested type.  By default, it will be a
Mail::Message.  This is correct, because it will be coerced into
the correct folder message type when it is added to that folder.

=back

. postlude => BODY|LINES

=over 4

The line(s) which to be added after the quoted reply lines.  Create a
body for it first.  This should not include the signature, which has its
own option.  The signature will be added after the postlude when the
reply is INLINEd.

=back

. prelude => BODY|LINES

=over 4

The line(s) which will be added before the quoted reply lines.  If nothing
is specified, the result of the L<replyPrelude()|Mail::Message::Construct::Reply/"Constructing a message"> method
is taken.  When C<undef> is specified, no prelude will be added.

=back

. quote => CODE|STRING

=over 4

Mangle the lines of an C<INLINE>d reply with CODE, or by prepending a
STRING to each line.  The routine specified by CODE is called when the
line is in C<$_>.

By default, C<'E<gt> '> is added before each line.  Specify C<undef> to
disable quoting.  This option is processed after the body has been decoded.

=back

. signature => BODY|MESSAGE

=over 4

The signature to be added in case of a multi-part reply.  The mime-type
of the signature body should indicate this is a used as such.  However,
in INLINE mode, the body will be taken, a line containing C<'-- '> added
before it, and added behind the epilogue.

=back

. strip_signature => REGEXP|STRING|CODE

=over 4

Remove the signature of the sender.  The value of this parameter is
passed to L<Mail::Message::Body::stripSignature(pattern)|Mail::Message::Body::Construct/"Constructing a body"> unless the
source text is not included.  The signature is stripped from the message
before quoting.

When a multipart body is encountered, and the message is included to
ATTACH, the parts which look like signatures will be removed.  If only
one message remains, it will be the added as single attachment, otherwise
a nested multipart will be the result.  The value of this option does not
matter, as long as it is present.  See L<Mail::Message::Body::Multipart|Mail::Message::Body::Multipart>.

=back

example: 

  my $reply = $msg->reply
   ( prelude         => "No spam, please!\n\n"
   , postlude        => "\nGreetings\n"
   , strip_signature => 1
   , signature       => $my_pgp_key
   , group_reply     => 1
   , 'X-Extra'       => 'additional header'
   );

=back

$obj-E<gt>B<replyPrelude>([STRING|FIELD|ADDRESS|ARRAY-OF-THINGS])

=over 4

Produces a list of lines (usually only one), which will preceded the
quoted body of the message.  STRING must comply to the RFC822 email
address specification, and is usually the content of a C<To> or C<From>
header line.  If a FIELD is specified, the field's body must be
compliant.  Without argument -or when the argument is C<undef>- a
slightly different line is produced.

An characteristic example of the output is

Mail::Message-E<gt>B<replySubject>(STRING)

=over 4

Create a subject for a message which is a reply for this one.  This routine
tries to count the level of reply in subject field, and transform it into
a standard form.  Please contribute improvements.

example: 

 subject                 --> Re: subject
 Re: subject             --> Re[2]: subject
 Re[X]: subject          --> Re[X+1]: subject

 subject (Forw)          --> Re[2]: subject

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Error: Cannot include reply source as $include.

=over 4

Unknown alternative for the C<include> option of L<reply()|Mail::Message::Construct::Reply/"Constructing a message">.  Valid
choices are C<NO>, C<INLINE>, and C<ATTACH>.
