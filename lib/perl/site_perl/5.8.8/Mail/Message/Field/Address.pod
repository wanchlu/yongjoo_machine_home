=head1 NAME

Mail::Message::Field::Address - One e-mail address

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Mail::Message::Field::Address
   is a Mail::Identity
   is a User::Identity::Item

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $addr = Mail::Message::Field::Address->new(...);

 my $ui   = User::Identity->new(...);
 my $addr = Mail::Message::Field::Address->coerce($ui);

 my $mi   = Mail::Identity->new(...);
 my $addr = Mail::Message::Field::Address->coerce($mi);

 print $addr->address;
 print $addr->fullName;   # possibly unicode!
 print $addr->domain;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Many header fields can contain e-mail addresses.  Each e-mail address
can be represented by an object of this class.  These objects will
handle interpretation and character set encoding and decoding for you.

=head1 OVERLOADED

overload: B<boolean>

=over 4

The object used as boolean will always return C<true>

=back

overload: B<stringification>

=over 4

When the object is used in string context, it will return the encoded
representation of the e-mail address, just like L<string()|Mail::Message::Field::Address/"Access to the content"> does.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

$obj-E<gt>B<coerce>(STRING|OBJECT, OPTIONS)

=over 4

Try to coerce the OBJECT into a C<Mail::Message::Field::Address>.
In case of a STRING, it is interpreted as an email address.

The OPTIONS are passed to the object creation, and overrule the values
found in the OBJECT.  The result may be C<undef> or a newly created
object.  If the OBJECT is already of the correct type, it is returned
unmodified.

The OBJECT may currently be a L<Mail::Address|Mail::Address>, a L<Mail::Identity|Mail::Identity>, or
a L<User::Identity|User::Identity>.  In case of the latter, one of the user's addresses
is chosen at random.

=back

$obj-E<gt>B<from>(OBJECT)

=over 4

See L<Mail::Identity/"Constructors">

=back

Mail::Message::Field::Address-E<gt>B<new>([NAME], OPTIONS)

=over 4

See L<Mail::Identity/"Constructors">

=back

$obj-E<gt>B<parse>(STRING)

=over 4

Parse the string for an address.  You never know whether one or more
addresses are specified on a line (often applications are wrong), therefore,
the STRING is first parsed for as many addresses as possible and then the
one is taken at random.

=head2 Accessors

$obj-E<gt>B<encoding>

=over 4

Character-set encoding, like 'q' and 'b', to be used when non-ascii
characters are to be transmitted.

=back

=head2 Access to the content

$obj-E<gt>B<string>

=over 4

Returns an RFC compliant e-mail address, which will have character
set encoding if needed.  The objects are also overloaded to call
this method in string context.

example: 

 print $address->string;
 print $address;          # via overloading

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Error: $object is not a collection.

=over 4

The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends
L<User::Identity::Collection|User::Identity::Collection>.

=back

Error: Cannot coerce a $type into a Mail::Message::Field::Address

=over 4

When addresses are specified to be included in header fields, they may
be coerced into L<Mail::Message::Field::Address|Mail::Message::Field::Address> objects first.  What
you specify is not accepted as address specification.  This may be an
internal error.

=back

Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).

=over 4

Either the specified $type does not exist, or that module named $class returns
compilation errors.  If the type as specified in the warning is not
the name of a package, you specified a nickname which was not defined.
Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.

=back

Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.

=over 4

The $class did compile, but it was not possible to create an object
of that class using the options you specified.

=back

Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.

=over 4

If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a
list of options which can be used to create a collection object.  In
the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.

=back

Warning: No collection $name

=over 4

The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.
