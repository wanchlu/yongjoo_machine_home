=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

I<Error:> $object is not a collection.

The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends
L<User::Identity::Collection|User::Identity::Collection>.

I<Error:> Cannot create a $type to add this to my collection.

Some options are specified to create a $type object, which is native to
this collection.  However, for some reason this failed.

I<Error:> Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).

Either the specified $type does not exist, or that module named $class returns
compilation errors.  If the type as specified in the warning is not
the name of a package, you specified a nickname which was not defined.
Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.

I<Error:> Cannot rename $name into $newname: already exists

I<Error:> Cannot rename $name into $newname: doesn't exist

I<Error:> Creation of a collection via $class failed.

The $class did compile, but it was not possible to create an object
of that class using the options you specified.

I<Error:> Don't know what type of collection you want to add.

If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a
list of options which can be used to create a collection object.  In
the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.

I<Warning:> No collection $name

The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.

I<Error:> Wrong type of role for $collection: requires a $expect but got a $type

Each $collection groups sets of roles of one specific type ($expect).  You
cannot add objects of a different $type.
