abortion/post_1115:Ok, the central theme thing is completely unfair, considering you were the one who originally argued about porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like. I merely countered your argument. So in reality your central theme seems to be sex. I won't disagree with your argument entirely. There are certainly a number of drawbacks to the sexual revolution. Namely in terms of the feminist revolution. We've taken a number of steps backwards in some inane desire to please men. The "playboy effect" is a very negative behavior that has resulted from the sexual revolution. This does not mean that the sexual revolution was all bad or that sex outside of marriage is bad. It's quite a jump to say that sex is only ok in a lifelong heterosexual marriage except for religious reasons. From a religious context, sure, it makes perfect sense, but outside of that it does not. For one, "lifelong" partnerships sometimes don't last a lifetime. For another, people are biologically programmed to sexual desires. Sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship, and I stand by my statement that there is nothing wrong with that. Furthermore, you entirely ignored my desire to quit debating non-abortion related issues within this debate. If you'd like to debate some other topic, let's start a new debate. (please and thank you)

abortion/post_374:You know, quotation marks ("") indicate that the words between them come from somewhere other than the writer.  In this format it typically indicates the words to which the author is responding.  So you should be addressing the author of the original post, but then you would be making my case.To answer the only worthwhile question in your post; very, very few.  If you're really interested, I'm sure a little research would give you several different numbers from which most people should be able to make an educated estimate as to what the actual number is.

abortion/post_380:While the argument is about the lesser of evils, you are absolutely right. Laws have to be written from an informed and practical point of view. Moral purity is great for conversations, but the unintended consequences of trying to force your moral code on other people can be worse than the original problem.

abortion/post_507:Your remark raises a valid point- which is that opposing   abortion   with no exceptions (which is not a view that I take personally) is supported by a small percent of the population, as is support for abortion in any cricumstances.  If you look at your own data, then 49% are clearly pro-choice and 47% are clearly pro-life.  Given a 3-4% margin of error, I think that there is no reason to regard this as a contradiction of my original thesis regarding a country which is split pretty evenly in half.  The question raised by the Mexico City Policy (MCP) was whether or not we should give financial support abroad to groups that would counsel women to have abortions as a form of family planning.  If half of the country would oppose this, then it cannot be consistent with our countries values.  It is consistant with half of the country and opposed by half.  Furthermore, poll data dealing specifically with the MCP shows that Obama's change in policy was supported by only about a third (35%) of the country- which makes it his least popular action to date.  -see link to Gallup poll below-  http://www.gallup.com/poll/114091/Americans-Approve-Obama-Actions-Date.aspx

abortion/post_603:Babies and the (disabled) elderly are most certainly dependent, and rely upon the care of an adult in order to survive.  The difference, however, is that ANY competent adult can reasonbly meet their survival needs.  In the case of a fetus prior to somewhere between 21-23 weeks, it is not capable of survival outside the uterus in which it originally implanted (at least, not at this stage of our medical/technological development).  It is, in essence, a "parasite" (by strict medical definition) upon the mother's system.  It is reliant upon continued physical embedding within the mother's system to survive.  It is incapable of survival outside the uterus, EVEN IF another adult is willing to take on its feeding and care.  That is the difference between viability outside the uterus and non-viability outside the uterus.  For purposes of determining whose rights supercede whose, I believe that the mother's rights to her own body and to governing the processes of her own body supercede any rights of the fetus until such time as the fetus would be viable outside of the uterus.That said, if a mother is planning to terminate her pregnancy for reasons other than life or health, I believe this definitely should be done prior to viability outside the uterus AND should be done absolutely as early in the pregnancy as she is aware that she is pregnant, preferably within the first couple of weeks past her missed period.I would love to see technology developed which could take a fetus or embryo as far back as fertilization, and allow that fetus to be removed from the uterus at any time and to develop in vitro to full term.  If such technology were available, I would agree that there was no further use for   abortion   other than for fetuses incapable of survival outside the uterus for reasons of physical malformation, such as anencephaly.  I would also love to see a world which so focused on the PREVENTION of unwanted pregnancies, that abortion rates fell to zero because every pregnancy was a planned and wanted pregnancy.  But we won't get to that point with "abstinence only" education.  We will need to learn to be frank with our youth about BOTH abstinence AND other forms of contraception, and to make those contraceptives easier to obtain than chewing gum.

The resposability of it's existence is it's mother's that engaged in a sexual intercourse. This is a basic difference from a parasite. The mother is not just some adult willing to take care of the child. There is a unique and beautiful connection between these two beings and it makes the case against   abortion   even more painful for this.So the only two things that the fetus needs is: food (by aid of the umbilical cord) and space (the womb). Just as babies need food (mother's milk) and a place to stay (it's mother's home). The only difference is that the babies needs can be replaced by any willing adult while before week 21-23 the baby needs can be covered by one person only:  it's mother. Isn't it sad that the one person that with her acting brought him to life and the one person who as the duty to take care of him is the one person that wants to terminate his life?

abortion/post_672:The claim that this is the only "logical answer" is positively absurd. If it's logical at the stage of a fertilized egg, why not at the sperm and ovum production? But those events can't happen without their host bodies first being born, so maybe it should be the grandparents' conception of the earliest parent. But then you run into the same issue and it regresses infinitely.Conception is certainly a choice and a point in time, but to claim that it is the only logical answer is utter inanity. Just as a fertilized egg is a component of a human finally being born, so are millions of other factors, many including the internal environment, incubation and nourishment of a fetus inside of a woman. To say that a fertilized egg *is* life would to be say that an engine *is* a vehicle. It simply isn't sufficient to produce a human.As long as we're talking about logic, we may as well examine actual logical constructs. A fertilized egg at the point of conception is a *necessary* condition for human life, but not a *sufficient* condition. As any logician knows, a consequence cannot come about without *all* necessary conditions (and at least one of them or an additional one being sufficient). Under this model, life could be defined as the point at which all necessary conditions (and at least one sufficient condition) have been fulfilled. Logically, that probably puts the event at the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the mother.Obviously that's not the only possibility for when "life" begins because the question is terribly broadafter all, sperm are most certainly alive. This is also not the best criteria for drawing a line for   abortion  , but it's indisputably more logical than the original author's weak and baseless claim.There are more pertinent questions to be asked in the abortion debate beyond this one, such as "When does a fetus achieve independent brain function?". On those topics there can certainly be fruitful and interesting debate, but this question is too broad and this "expert" is tragically nave.

abortion/post_675:My original point was that on the nec/suf issue, you granted the former but made no positive argument for the latter, whereas the article was arguing that if the latter is not excluded it would be 'rational' not to err on the side of possibly taking a human life.If you just want to consider life as equivalent to independent life, then you're attempting to bypass the problem entirely by redefining 'life'.  People who are uncontroversially alive can be incapable of surviving independent of life support.  Unless people on respirators are "un-alive", that would eliminate independence as a necessary condition.Warts, moles, and tumors are not germane.  They are just body tissue which may not be functioning normally.  A zygotes is not a part of the woman's body.A chunk of metal, if left alone, will remain a chunk of metal (or deteriorate).  A zygote, if left alone, will begin the process of developing into a person.  The argument that because something is not in a state now entails that we should treat it no differently than something which is not particularly likely to enter that state is irrational.  If a boulder were rolling down a hillside toward my car and I regarded it is merely another rock on a hill, then I would be foolish.Logic can point out that an argument is invalid, but it can't speak to the merit of a definition.  Logic won't help the post-conception side any more than the pre-conception side.

abortion/post_690:We can all agree that a fertilized egg is alive. But so also is an unfertilized egg or a sperm. They're not dead, and they're not inanimate objects like a stone. Almost every cell in my body is alive. Life began eons ago, and continues uninterrupted from one generation to the next. So we're not talking about the beginning of life, but the beginning of a particular living individual.Genetically, we could say that a new individual begins when a new combination of genes emerges. This happens whenever an egg or a sperm is formed, and it happens again when an egg combines with a sperm. The latter combination usually lasts longer than the former, but does that make it the only beginning of an individual?And when a fertilized egg divides into two identical twins with no change in genetic profile, are they both still the same individual as was the original cell? If not -- if identical twins are different individuals, then unique genetics must not be the definition of a unique individual. So what is the significance of the fertilization of an egg? Maybe a fertilzed egg is just a potential human being, or dog, or whatever, in the same way that a sperm or unfertilized egg is. Maybe it's the development of a functioning, thinking brain with a unique mind that constitutes the beginning of an individual. That seems to make sense.The religious, of course, substitute the word "soul" for "mind," and they speculate blindly about when the soul is assigned to the body, having absolutely no information on the subject. Interestingly, as well, I believe they tend to conceive of the soul as much more mature than the rudimentary single-cell body it supposedly inhabits, capable from the beginning of self-awareness and thought and probably a love of God. That's why killing a brainless single cell is repulsive to them. It really is just a religious issue.

abortion/post_691:Using Christianity as the answer, let's look at the Bible:Genesis 2:7: "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."Genesis 6:17: "And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die."Genesis 7:22: "All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died."Job 33:4:"The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life."Psalm 33:6: "By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth."Psalm 150:6: "Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Praise the LORD."Genesis 25:8: "Then Abraham breathed his last and died . . ."These are only a few examples of this symbolism.Against all this, the proponents of conception as the divider will trot out Jeremiah 1:5: "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."The biblical concept is human being becomes alive when the soul enters the body upon birth and the taking of the first breath.  This Christian belief was the basis for the English common   law   of inheritance, for example, noted by the SCOTUS in Roe v. Wade.Biblical references to death refer to "breathing his last."  Now   add   the symbolic essence of the Sacrament of Baptism. Not the pouring of   water   version symbolizing cleansing the soul of Original Sin, but the original (and still common) form by immersion.Immersion of the individual in water symbolizes a return to the womb, and when brought back up, there isa rebirth in Christ Jesus, symbolized by the taking of a new "first breath."Christian teaching in the 13th Century approved of   abortion   until "quickening" or a more formalistic (and different) number of weeks of gestation for male and female fetuses.  This can be found in papal writings as well as in St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologiae.Current Catholic teaching sets conception as the start. It's clear to me that such a standard should only be imposed on those who believe in such a faith formulation in opposition to the Bible-based truth spanning the human life from first breath to last breath.Creating a   legal   standard based on beginning human life at conception would be to define the end of human life as the termination of the process of decay.  we could expect:a. funeral rites where there is a spontaneous abortion or even an unusually heavy flow after being late with their mensesb. changes in the laws of descent and distributionc. a de-emphasis on "birthday" celebrations and a new emphasis on celebrating approximate "conception day" anniversaries(with my four   children  , I know an exact date my daughter was conceived, or at least the exact time of the romantic interlude - actual conception could have been a day or even two later.  With the other three, all I can do is count back a couple of weeks or so from "missing.")d. a reformulation of the sacrament of baptism to perhaps eliminate immersion in favor of the "cleansing the soul" motif engendered by pouring watere. all sorts of issues in automobile negligence and other tort lawsuits.It's one thing to respect the process of construction - and quite another to call the structure a house from the time the plans are drawn by the architect and the building permit is issued.  Of course, people don't tend to build houses by accident, while   pregnancy   is often enough an unintended consequence.Human life in the abstract is a continuum - the egg that provided half my genetic blueprint was formed in my   mother  's mother's womb some time in 1927 or 1928, while the sperm that contained the other half was generated some time in the week or two before my conception in the early 1950's. And there was a point in those early 1950's when the eggs that would ultimately "become" my four children were formed, while the sperm that prvided the other half of their   nuclear   genetic inheritance were formed in the span from 1980 to the very early 1990's.In one regard, human life is a continuum without a real ending or beginning, and in another, the span of the life of a human being is between first and last breath.I believe in respecting life, even that of pre-born   babies   who are not yet legally human beings.  But I cannot in good conscience impose my own belief on someone else who does not believe the same way.

abortion/post_697:Our definitions are essentially the same, you just misapply the definition."The range of capabilities that someone or something has; powers or resources not yet developed or made use of."  While, like most dictionary definitions, this is vague and not completely accurate in a philosophical sense, it is still mostly correct.  My definition is essentially the same as well, but taken from Aristotle's definition of potentiality, "Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if it is not prevented by something else."Common definitions are a slippery idea. For example, presently the word "liberal" (in a political context) is defined as one who seeks greater government regulation and an expansion of welfare programs.  However, the original definition of "liberal" defined a person who believed in severely limited government and free-market capitalism.  In fact, many founders of the Libertarian movement considered themselves "liberals."Even using your "exact" definition (assuming that we have an exact definition and not just a colloquial summary, you are still confusing potentiality with possibility.In effect, you are interpreting the definition as if you could say, "a person has the potential to be hit by a car."  This makes no logical sense.  That person however exists with that possibility.Indeed, you could argue that the wood has the potential to be a table.  Yes, this is correct when certain linguistic obscurities are overlooked.  The can the wood actually do? Nothing.  That is, until it is made into something.  So what we should say is the wood has the potential to be made into a table, not to be a table.Now, considering your absurd example, If your appendix cell where on the street completely alone, it would not have human rights. It is no longer part of your entity.  This is the same idea as, if your hair falls out in my house or car, I can dispose of it.  It is no longer "your" hair.  As long as a thing is connected to you and is of your person-hood it is completely yours and I cannot touch itA fetus is connected to the mother, but it is not of her person-hood and should at least qualify for certain basic rights. Your example of in vitro makes no logical sense.   I never said that a scientifically engineered human wouldn't be human.  I said, the cells that they make them out of are not potential humans, when the cells are considered individually.  Once they have been engineered into a fetus, then they are definitely potential humans. You are quoting me out of context.  My argument was that a single sperm is not "a potential human until it unites with an egg."  No, a single sperm will not become a human of its own accord.  It would have to be made into a human.  In essence, it is a potential potentiality, but anything can be broken down into degrees or potential potentiality.  So that is a concept we should stay away from. Anyhow, I would appreciate it if you would not take my statements out of context and apply meanings to them that I never stated. Don't be mistaken, I never once said or implied that I would make   abortion   illegal, nor do I speculate as to the application of these certain basic rights of a fetus or whose, mother's or fetus', rights take precedence in what cases. All I said was you misapplied the concept of potentiality.

creation/post_1041:Wow...where to start?First, there is no such thing as an "evolutionist". Evolution is not a religion or belief system, but instead a well tested theory backed up by evidence in many scientific fields such as geology, embryology, genetics, and other fields of biology. A more accurate term to use would be scientist because over 99% of scientists agree with evolution. But hey, what do they know?I will talk about the evidence for evolution later but first allow me to answer some of your questions:Then why is the top of Mt Everest covered in fossilized clams?That's simple. The surface of the earth is covered by large masses of land known as tectonic plates. There are two types of tectonic plates, oceanic and continental. When two continental plates collide, mountains form. In this case, the Indian subcontinent collided with the Eurasian Plate forming the Himalayas. In fact this collision is still occurring and Mt. Everest is rising a few inches each year. What does this have to do with fossilized clams? At one point during earth's history, the rocks that currently make up the Himalayas were underwater and during this time the clams would have been fossilized. The mountains were raised later. In addition, if you are trying to say that these clams are evidence of the biblical flood (if you are not please correct me), then you should know that fossilization of the type witnessed on the top of Mt. Everest could not have happened in a short amount of time. They would have to have been covered for thousands of years. Didn't the flood supposedly only last 40 days?Why have sets of human footprints have been found on top and next to dinosaur footprints?Short answer: They haven'tLong Answer: Although creationists originally claimed that "man-tracks" appeared with dinosaur prints near in Glen Rose Texas, these assertions were later proven to be false. The supposed human footprints were in fact shown to be dinosaur footprints that had been eroded, natural features, and some doctored and carved specimens.Why are there so many "fossil graveyards" (the result of swirling water eddies)?Could you be more specific? I have never heard the term fossil graveyard, and I fail to see how this could possibly point to "swirling water eddies."Why did the earth have to be created instantaneously (www.halos.com)?This theory was thought up by Robert Gentry, who based his conclusion on what he called "halos" found in certain primordial rocks. Gentry is a physicist not a geologist however, so his method of observations, and the conclusions he comes to are flawed. You might as well ask a plumber to falsify string theory. The problems with his research are numerous, but for the sake of brevity I will give you the basic reasons why he's wrong. - The rocks he was examining were not part of the primordial crust of earth, but instead much younger, and therefore not reflective of earth's formation. -He does not show that polonium is the only possible cause of the "halos." In fact, other scientists who reviewed his work have determined that Uranium (which decays much more slowly) is the real cause. This is because the rings were most common in areas that were Uranium rich. If the cause had been Polonium, this would not have been the case. -Gentry attempts to rationalize the apparent conflict between his results and all other geological evidence for the age of earth, by proposing that decay rates have changed. There is no evidence for this, and the phenomenon is impossible according to current atomic theory. If he is right, then there is no reason that Polonium decay rates couldn't have changed as well, and therefore his entire conclusion is baseless-His theory requires at least three instances of divine intervention. Science does not deal with the supernatural.Then why have fossilized whales been found standing vertically on their tails?What does this have to do with anything? I don't know specifically what your talking about, however, if I were to speculate this could be because either rocks containing the fossils were pushed vertically by volcanic or tectonic activity, or that an underwater avalanche buried a whale vertically. Until you show me specifically what your talking about though, these are just guesses.Why are the layers of coal formations connected?Once again, I'm not sure what your talking about.Out of the billions of fruit flies/bacteria generations observed, why have they only produced after their kind?I assume by kind you mean species. If that is the case, then you are severely mistaken. There are numerous examples of observed speciation, especially among bacteria. In fact, in 1975, a strain of bacteria was found that could digest nylon. Nylon was only invented in 1935, so this was obviously an evolved trait. Fruit flys have also been observed in laboratories to evolve. In addition we see bugs evolving all the time, to become resistant to pesticides. If you want more examples of instances of observed speciation look here.Why is the age of the earth severely limited?: The moon is moving away from the earth each year, and would have been touching earth 1.3 billion years ago; long before then lunar tides would have wiped out life. Earth's spin is slowing down, so less than a million years ago it would it have been going much too fast for anything to survive (centrifugal force, 5,000 mph winds).Your figures are out of date. The whole, moon touching the earth 1.3 billion years ago, was a problem in the 1960s. Since then, newer and more accurate models of the earth-moon system put the moon a good distance away from the earth 4 billion years ago. Scientists had to take into account how shifting landmasses on earth (due to tectonic activity) had an effect on the moon's movement.Your second claim is laughable. I don't really know how to answer you other than to say that it's not true. Yesterday the temperature was one degree colder than today. Does that mean I can conclude there as an ice age less than a year ago? The earth is slowing down, but not nearly in the way that you described.Okay, now that that's over with we can talk about evidence for evolution.Out of all the claims, I've never heard any solid evidence to support themI'd say that's probably because creationist blogs don't have much information on the topic. I however do. Let's break it up into a couple catagories:FossilsScientists have been able to date fossils that are millions of years old, using numerous different techniques. What we see, when we look at the fossils we've found is a very clear representation of the evolutionary tree of life. Scientists have found literally thousands of transitional fossils, and not a single fossil has not fit within what evolution predicts. There were no mammals found during the Precambrian period, and no dinosaurs that dated less than 50 million years ago.If evolution were not true then how could you explain:1) How every dating technique used to identify the age of the fossils, turned up the same result? and how all of these results were consistent with evolutions predictions?2) How these transitional fossils exist?Observed instances of speciationAs I said earlier in the debate, we can actually see species evolving. The reason that the flu vaccine must be updated every year, is because the flu virus evolves each year. In this case, our knowledge of evolution actually saves people's lives. So you must ask yourself:3) If evolution isn't true, then why do we still see things evolving?I could go on, but this argument is already too long. If you have more questions go ahead and ask, but I'm much more interested in answers.

creation/post_1045:I think you have some misconceptions about what evolution actually is. Nothing ever changes into something completely different...that's impossible. Every generation is the same species as the previous generation, but with some added mutations orginally these mutations occur to the point where the end species cannot mate with the original, and that is where biologists arbitrarily draw the line as to a different species. In this sense we have seen many many examples of evolution.In addition, we really do see new species of bacteria, and no it wouldn't take millions of years for them to evolve into a new species. It might take a long time for them to be mostly unrecognizeable from their parent species but dissimilarity to an ancester species is not a requirement to the observation of evolution.In addition you claim that you would only except that scientists have observed evolution if they saw something without wings evolve into something with wings. Now obviously this is virtually impossible because the chances of parralel evolution of an exact same feature are virtually none, however I'm pretty sure you were being fecicious. Would you instead settle for the evolution of a mechanism in an organism that could didn't exist previously?I present for your consideration nylon-eating bacteria. Nylon obviously wasn't invented until 1935 and therefore this mechanism could not possibly have existed before this time.So there, it's not feathers but it is evolution.

creation/post_111:that one is from Isaiah 40:22... and is old testament.. very ancient stuff. 740-680 b.c. is commonly held. The point being.. just when in history did we learn the Earth was circular? Around 300 years later Aristotle proposed the idea in his book 'on the heavens'.. but it wasn't accepted as a given.Yet the concept of a circular Earth is far older then that.  Indian texts dating back to 1000 BCE can be interpreted just as easily to indicate a spherical planet.''He [   god   ] hangs the Earth on nothing'But the Earth is not hung on nothing, it is tethered by the laws of gravity.first off..this is from Job - and as I recall that was old testament stuff as well -definitely B.C. - which I believe is in the dead sea scrolls as well.. at the time people had various beliefs about the Earth... whether it be it was on the backs of infinite turtles or the like... and many other views -. but the knowledge that the Earth floats in space was not known as a fact.And what of the passages that are interpreted by geocentrists about fixing the Earth in the ferment?  The point is not that the Bible should be used as a   science   handbook - it was never intended to be so..that was never it's intended purpose.Yet you have said that the Bible is correct in every detail and thus that its description of the creation of the Earth is scientific fact.  You have even stated that the phrases about   stretching   are describing the accelerating universe.   Thus the Bible can be used to determine new theories as well.  After all if scientists had paid more attention to the Bible then the accelerating universe would not have been a surprise to them (remember that an accelerating universe was not among the original three outcomes of our observations regarding the expanding universe).The point is that this 'primitive' text is consistent with science - and appears to be ahead of it's time from the things it points out, some of which would ironically be heresy at the time.Remember that scholars of that time knew that the Earth was round (it is surprisingly easy to prove really).  Indeed the Greeks were very close to showing that the Earth revolved around the sun, put off only because they had miscalculated the size of the universe (lacking telescopes they could not correctly calculate stellar distances using parallax)descriptions of the process of water evaporation and clouds..Which can easily be observed by the people at that time, Aristotle himself gave crude descriptions of cloud formation processes.it goes directly against God's purposes... as I mentioned to you before - it is necessary for God to maintain 'plausible deniability'.. a rough balance... he has to give enough evidence to support belief - yet not so much that it would make faith unnecessaryWhat about all the stuff in the Old Testament?  Huge tracts of that book are devoted to God explicitly existing The Flood, Sodom and Gomorra, the Seven Plagues, the Burning Bush,   the Parting of the Red Sea.   There is no plausible deniability when you are walking across the floor of the Red Sea.Where does God get the   energy   to do so?..You are kidding right?No, Im not.  Or is this a God did it point where we cannot go any further?  Is there no possible physical explanation for this phenomenon?

creation/post_123:On Pandasthumb, Nick Matzke, whose contributions to Dover v Kitzmiller were instrumental in the stunning defeat of Intelligent Design and whose contributions to exposing the fallacies in Behe''s arguments as well as the extent of ignorance of science amongst ID proponents has caused much concern amongst ID proponents, so much that in general they have chosen to pretend, in a typical creationist fashion, that Matzke's arguments do not exist. In this example, Matzke shows how Luskin's attempts to rebut the Kitzmiller decision by exposing the scientific vacuity of ID, once again backfire in light of the current state of scientific knowledge.   http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/09/luskin-and-the-2.html   Nick Matzke:Over on the opposingviews.com website, Casey Luskin of the DI tries to rebut the Kitzmiller decision by re-fighting Behes spectacular implosion on the issue of the evolution of the vertebrate immune system. To review, in his 1996 book Darwins Black Box, Behe claimed that:--Behe    As scientists we yearn to understand how this magnificent mechanism came to be, but the complexity of the system dooms all Darwinian explanations to frustruation. (Darwins Black Box, p. 139)    We can look high or we can look low, in books or in journals, but the result is the same. The scientific literature has no answers to the question of the origin of the immune system. (Darwins Black Box, p. 138)--(PvM: Note how these are the typical ID arguments against science, we do not know, thus designed)As the debate over irreducible complexity developed in the next decade, the most detailed arguments would go basically like this:--    ID: Gradual evolution by natural selection cant produce IC structures because any structure missing a part would be nonfunctional    Evo: You are ignoring cooption of structures with different functions, which has a been a major feature of the evolutionary explanation of complex structures ever since the Origin of Species.    ID: Cooption explanations are too improbable.    Evo: Why?    ID: Because we say so.    Evo: But homology evidence shows that IC systems lacking parts can still have other functions, and therefore your claim that structures missing parts would be nonfunctional is wrong    ID: OK well I dont have a comeback on that point, so instead I will claim that evolutionary cooption explanations arent detailed & tested enough to satisfy me.    Evo: Heres a bunch of detailed & tested research papers on the evolution of system X.    ID: Not detailed enough. I need every single mutation & selection pressure before I admit that evolution produced this IC system rather than ID.--At this point the ID proponent has abandoned the original argument and therefore lost, even though he wont admit it. Knowing all of this before the Kitzmiller trial, we devised ways to bring this point to the attention of the judge. The most famous example was the fabled immune system cross. A large amount of evidence was submitted that showed how the key feature of the vertebrate adaptive immune system, rearranging immune receptors (antibodies), evolved. Read the rest at    http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/09/luskin-and-the-2.html    and educate yourself on the current status of science regarding the immune system and its evolution, and compare it with how ID 'explains' said immune system ('poof').

creation/post_124:I read the entire article.. and of course not being a member of the various fields of genetic research - it was not simple reading, nor did I understand even half of the references they made to various receptors and such.  That considered... it appears to not actually prove the point and also does not answer Behe's original question.also the comments show mixed reactions - and many of the readers reacted as I did... the original question was disregarded. First and foremost - how does an animal without an immune system survive to acquire one.  You would need to live to do so.... a dead animal does not good genetics make.This is what Behe asked... instead what we have is a list of genetic comparisons of immune systems.. showing some as simple and some as complex... well, duh.   This is the same technique as lining up skeletons and saying 'see.... a progression!'.... or not a progression - depending on whether you want to commit to a   crime   of assumption.and besides... the article is about an ID trial... and Behe was presented with this pile of information... how could the judge (who is a judge by trade.. not a geneticist) decide whether or not these technical papers had proven anything?in the articles words ''Judge Jones ruled that Dr. Miller presented peer-reviewed studies refuting Professor Behes claim that the immune system was irreducibly complex.''how would the judge know that... ?  He could have handed the judge a pile of recipes for sponge cake and called it a refutation.

creation/post_179:"ID simply predicted that the appendix would have a function. The degree of specificity in our predictions concerning what an intelligence will or will not do is limited due to intelligent agents having freedom in their creation. For example, we can predict that Tom Cruises next movie will be an action flick, but we cannot predict the plot of the movie before he agrees to a part."If it cannot make predictions then it is not a viable theory.  Remember that the current research into the use of the appendix was done using evolutionary models, not design models."t is true that   evolution   (   change   over time) has been observed to act quickly, but the theory of evolution has from day one predicted that this change has always occurred step-by-step."When evidence was produced to the contrary, that evolution can occur suddenly, the theory was adjusted to reflect that information.  In the Modern Synthesis theory it is recognized that significant changes can occur within the span of a few generations."The first time this prediction was made using the theory of evolution was in the Origin of Species."The Origin of the Species is a historical document... there was much that Darwin did not know at that time that we now know, and his original theory has since been supplanted by more modern versions of his theory."However, the Cambrian Explosion demonstrated this prediction to be false even before random natural processes wrote the Origin of Species."I'm not quite sure I follow you... Charles Darwin would not have been aware of the Cambrian explosion, so there is no way he could have included it.As to the 'Cambrian Explosion'... it took place over the span of ~10 million years, hardly a sudden change.  "Specified complexity describes any sort of pattern. Some patterns are specific but not complex (eg., gtgtgtgtg). Some patterns are complex but not specific (eg., ctaagtcg). Some patterns are both specific and complex (eg., gattaca)."That is still not very descriptive... can you demonstrate that the sequence gtgtgtg is less likely to occur via random chance then ctaagtcg?  Assuming a purely random system (each bit selected randomly) they would have an identical chance of occurring."Exactly. Ken Miller has claimed to have tested a supposedly untestable claim, a claim that is supposedly religious and has nothing to do with   science   ."It was put forth that the flagellum was irreducibly complex, this was shown to be false (a simple change led to a structure that was different but still functional)."The Lenski study did not show e. coli changing into a different species of bacteria via undirected processes. The bacteria began as e. coli and ended as e. coli. "Yet it demonstrated a radical change over the comparatively short span of twenty years.  "Even if e. coli did change into a different species, the study would not justify inferring that all life changes into new species via non-intelligent processes."One study would not be enough... but when combined with the body of evidence for Evolution it is a very powerful demonstration of the change."Concerning the paper published in Science, the author claimed that ID is untestable immediately after claiming that it had been tested and refuted. This contradiction was ignored by the reviewers and editors of the journal."The experiment was not testing ID, it was testing Evolution... can you describe an experiment similar to the Lenski experiment that could be used to test ID?"I could remind you of many examples of homo sapiens intelligently altering organisms, but I cannot show you a non-homo sapien live and in-person designing anything."Why not?  What experiment could be performed to show the action of a designer?"Intelligent Design is inferred from the evidence, much like the intelligent design of pyramids is inferred from the evidence even though no one can actually show me Egyptians building them thousands of years ago."There is a massive amount of evidence showing that the Egyptians built the pyramids.  There is their own records, the carvings on the structure itself, known mechanisms by which the pyramid could be built... is there a similar body of evidence for id?"Unobserved entities are allowed in science, such as dark matter/   energy   ."Dark matter is observed through its interaction with matter.  Dark energy is still rather theoretical in nature, though the universe is expanding at an increasing rate there is no described mechanism for its action.

creation/post_181:"there was much that Darwin did not know at that time that we now know, and his original theory has since been supplanted by more modern versions of his theory."First, don't make a   darwin  -of-the-gaps argument.  Intelligent causation has no role in   science  .  Second, if conflicting evidence does not refute evolutionary theory, then neither does it refute ID.  Why can't ID simply be revised rather than abandoned if there is ever conflicting evidence?"Charles Darwin would not have been aware of the Cambrian explosion."  There is no evidence that such a being existed.  However, the Origin of Species does talk about the Cambrian Explosion as problematic.  "The abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain formations, has been urged by several palaeontologistsfor instance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and Sedgwickas a fatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species. If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of   evolution   through natural selection. - p. 344; "The case at present must remain inexplicable, and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained. -p. 351."can you demonstrate that the sequence gtgtgtg is less likely to occur via random chance then ctaagtcg?"I never stated that gtgtgtg was less likely to occur than ctaagtcg.  Since it contains only two letters instead of 4 it would actually be more likely to occur, but that's not the point.  What's-his-face asked me to explain what is meant by specified complexity and that is what I did."It was put forth that the flagellum was irreducibly complex, this was shown to be false"An untestable claim cannot be shown to be false.

creation/post_232:2. Behe claims that normal evolutionary processes cannot, or are very unlikely, to produce irreducibly complex systems that make the cell "reek of design."  Behe, while he claims Lenski's work shows that evolution doesn't lead to new complexity and new systems, someone manages to avoid mentioning that that Lenski's E. coli bacteria were able to evolve a new biochemical pathway that could eat citrate, a chemical that E. coli in the wild cannot eat (Blount, Z.D., Borland, C.Z., and Lenski, R.E. 2008. Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of Escherichia coli. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A 105:7899-7906.).  Behe was forced to write a laughable response (    http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/post/PLNK3U696N278Z93O     ) that dodged the implications (evolution even in a limited lab population can produce a new beneficial system, i.e. an improvement that was not "degradative"), but, as per his modus operandi, he will dance and redefine his terms rather than admit that his argument against evolution has been falsified.Unfortunately for Behe, Lenski's work is not isolated.  The adaptation of bacteria to eat substrates that are indigestible to the wild-type bacteria -- or even compounds that are toxic -- is an extremely common phenomenon in labs that has been known for decades.  And it is known to occur in the wild.  There are several cases where bacteria in the wild have developed the ability to break down compounds that purely anthropogenic -- that is, chemicals that did not exist in the environment until humans manufactured them.  For this very reason, these chemicals are often good preservatives (for example, wooden telephone polls) and/or highly toxic.  They are often considered pollutants in the soil or water, so a fair bit of work has gone into discovering what happens to them.  Again and again, the pattern seems to be that after a few decades, some bacterium has assembled a novel pathway -- always by assembling and modifying pre-existing enzymes with other original functions.  Well-known examples include nylon, PCP (pentachlorophenol, a preservative of e.g. wood), and 2,4-DNT (dinitrotoluene, a breakdown product of the explosive TNT, or trinitrotoluene, which is often a soil pollutant on military bases).  In at least the cases of PCP and 2,4-DNT, the breakdown pathways have multiple required parts, and therefore ought to be considered irreducibly complex (except that Behe will often dodge here also and invoke a "strict" definition of IC which excludes metabolic pathways, a definition which he invokes only when convenient, and which is arbitrary because the IC argument really only relies on the "multiple required features, too improbable to evolve at once" logic; in other situations he and his allies have declared various metabolic pathways to be IC when it seems to help the argument).One more alternative might be to say that evolution hasn't produced anything "new" in these situations, only re-used old parts.  This too would be the ID advocates sawing off the limb they sitting on; for every "irreducibly complex" system the ID guys like to tout as evidence for ID -- the flagellum, the cilium, the immune system, the blood-clotting cascade, etc. -- is basically just a combination of parts known to have other functions in related organisms or systems.  The parts have statistically strong sequence similarity, and sequence similarity is explained by copying, and copying of sequence is the result of gene duplication, which (along with subsequent modification) is the main explanation that evolutionary biologists have invoked for the origin of new genes and "new information" for generations.  The ID advocates have almost completely ignored this simple, obvious, well-documented, testable, and well-tested explanation for biological "information" and "complexity" for nearly 20 years now.  This demonstrates scientific incompetence and carelessness, and lends support to the view (which is undeniable but outside the scope of this post; read the Kitzmiller decision for some of that) that ID is not about good science at all, but really just a branch of conservative religious apologetics.

creation/post_240:Michael Behe may be best known for his book "Darwin's Black Box" and to a lesser extent its sequel "The Edge of evolution". Both books attempt to show that there limits (edges) to evolutionary theory which cannot be crossed.Let's first point out that much of Behe's argument is not with evolutionary theory itself but a component of said theory, namely natural selection. For instance, his Irreducible Complexity argument relies on the (erroneous) claim that processes of variation and selection (aka Darwinian processes) are unable to explain systems which are 'irreducibly complex (IC)". In order to understand why Behe is wrong, one need not look further than     http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/behe.html    First of all the problem of IC systems and its solution was pointed out by a Nobel Prize winner and evolutionary scientist almost a century ago (    http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/ICsilly.html    )Muller, H. J. (1918) "Genetic variability, twin hybrids and constant hybrids, in a case of balanced lethal factors." Genetics 3:422-499. Muller, H. J. (1939) "Reversibility in evolution considered from the standpoint of genetics." Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society 14:261-280. ---    "... thus a complicated machine was gradually built up whose effective working was dependent upon the interlocking action of very numerous different elementary parts or factors, and many of the characters and factors which, when new, were originally merely an asset finally became necessary because other necessary characters and factors had subsequently become changed so as to be dependent on the former. It must result, in consequence, that a dropping out of, or even a slight change in any one of these parts is very likely to disturb fatally the whole machinery; for this reason we should expect very many, if not most, mutations to result in lethal factors ..."    Muller 1918 pp. 463-464. (emphasis in the original)        "... an embryological or physiological process or structure newly arisen by gene mutation, after becoming once established (with or without the aid of selection), later takes more and more part in the whole complex interplay of vital processes. For still further mutations that arise are now allowed to stay if only they work in harmony with all genes that are already present, and, of these further mutations, some will naturally depend, for their proper working, on the new process or structure under consideration. Being thus finally woven, as it were, into the most intimate fabric of the organism, the once novel character can no longer be withdrawn with impunity, and may have become vitally necessary."    Muller 1939 pp. 271-272.---However, Keith Robison described a very similar example where simple evolutionary processes lead to a system which is IC  (    http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/behe/review.html    )--So, duplication plus a loss of function, plus one of two different loss-of-function mutations can convert a single step pathway into a two step cascade. The initial  steps are neutral, neither advantageous nor disadvantageous. Such neutral mutations occur regularly. The final step locks in the cascade.--ID's objections to the above scenario are that it involves neutral steps and are thus not 'Darwinian' in nature, but like Darwin, evolutionary science accepts that selection is but one of various processes and the importance of neutrality on evolution has been historically underestimated.Dembski, understanding one of Behe's flaws redefined IC to read--    A system performing a given basic function is irreducibly complex if it includes a set of well-matched, mutually interacting, nonarbitrarily individuated parts such that each part in the set is indispensable to maintaining the system's basic, and therefore original, function. The set of these indispensable parts is known as the irreducible core of the system. (No Free Lunch, 285)--Note the addition of 'original function', this prevents the most common pathways in evolution to be irrelevant to explaining IC systems, but now Dembski has to show that indeed, original function was maintained in any particular system. While this may have temporarily saved Behe's original fomulation, it has merely defined IC systems to be something which is much harder to establish as it involves a historical component of 'original function'.

creation/post_249:Behe claims that "That is not the sort of process one needs to build complex molecular systems." when discussing the experiment by Richard Lenski. What Behe forgets to mention are the actual findings of the research such as"Over the generations, in fits and starts, the bacteria did indeed evolve into faster breeders. The bacteria in the flasks today breed 75% faster on average than their original ancestor."and they also showed some interesting findings that show how beneficial/detrimental depends on the environment"Lenski and his colleagues have also shown how natural selection has demanded trade-offs from the bacteria; while they grow faster on a meager diet of glucose, they've gotten worse at feeding on some other kinds of sugars."and a remarkable mutation which caused the bacteria to feast on the citrate"But in one remarkable case, however, they discovered that a flask had turned cloudy without any contamination. It was E. coli chowing down on the citrate. The researchers found that when they put the bacteria in pure citrate, the microbes could thrive on it as their sole source of carbon."and countering behe's claims, the evidence actually suggested that this was a change in multiple sites, something Behe has argued cannot happen"This rise and fall and rise suggests that the evolution of citrate-eating was not a one-mutation affair. The first mutation (or mutations) allowed the bacteria to eat citrate, but they were outcompeted by some glucose-eating mutants that still had the upper hand. Only after they mutated further did their citrate-eating become a recipe for success."In an earlier article in the NY Times, it was reported that these bacteria were not the same ones "In that time, the bacteria have changed significantly. For one thing, they are bigger  twice as big on average as their common ancestor. They are also far better at reproducing in these flasks, dividing 70 percent faster than their ancestor. These changes have emerged through spontaneous mutations and natural selection, and Dr. Lenski and his colleagues have been able to watch them unfold."Of course, none of these bacteria evolved into mammals, something hardly expected given the limited timescales involved, however contrary to Behe's claims, these bacteria started to feed on citrate even though such a feat required multiple changes.It seems clear that even these trivial examples of hard scientific work show not only that ID remains scientifically vacuous but also that ID has to reject and ignore contradicting evidence that shows it to be wrong. What's even worse about ID being scientifically vacuous? In my opinion, ID being wrong and knowing it.Read more about the experiment first hand at:     http://myxo.css.msu.edu/index.html

What Behe forgets to mention are the actual findings of the research such as"Over the generations, in fits and starts, the bacteria did indeed evolve into faster breeders. The bacteria in the flasks today breed 75% faster on average than their original ancestor.""At what cost? Did these new super-breeders need to eliminate some proteins or functions from their systems in order to achieve this ability? Do the faster breeders still have the same efficiency in the functions Lenski describes? What about population size? Despite the rapid breeding, did the population size remain the same, or did they just draw the claim of rapid breeding based on the time it took for new generations to arise?"and they also showed some interesting findings that show how beneficial/detrimental depends on the environment"Now that's a spectacular way to cover one's ass when they know they've run into a wall. Just say that the fitness only depends on the environment, and even if they show some losses in their current environment, they would do just fine and possibly even better if we just tried a new set of environmental settings. So I'm assuming that when the nylonase only had 2% the efficiency of typical enzymes, it was because we just didn't have the right environment for the bacteria, am I right?http://209.85.173.132/search?q=cache:MX7Px_DB75IJ:  www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm  +nylonase+  evolution  +The+new+enzymes+are+very+inefficient+(having+only+2%25+of+the+efficiency+of+the+regular+enzymes)&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us"and a remarkable mutation which caused the bacteria to feast on the citrate"This is only a fraction of the whole equation, did the bacteria retain the same efficiency? Did it retain the same population levels? Did it have to shed other functions in the process? Without this information we have no way of knowing if anything was gained or lost in this whole process."and countering behe's claims, the evidence actually suggested that this was a change in multiple sites, something Behe has argued cannot happen"I'm assuming your referring to chloroquine resistance and Edge of Evolution? I'm sure it's more than likely to happen, but not without some loss in the original functionality of the organism in question. Speaking of multiple mutations.....  http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/A3DGRQ0IO7KYQ2/ref  =cm_blog_blogCan wait to read the posts that follow...."In an earlier article in the NY Times, it was reported that these bacteria were not the same ones"Tell us the article please, just so we can know for sure you're not making this up."Of course, none of these bacteria evolved into mammals, something hardly expected given the limited timescales involved, however contrary to Behe's claims, these bacteria started to feed on citrate even though such a feat required multiple changes."See the previous points. The question at hand is whether or not Darwin's mechanism can produce the "apparent" design in nature. Now for your claim to even be relevant to this question, I would suggest that you give us the full picture and explain whether or not the citrate feeding bacteria retained the same efficiency, breeding rate, and functionality as their earlier counter-parts. "It seems clear that even these trivial examples of hard scientific work show not only that ID remains scientifically vacuous but also that ID has to reject and ignore contradicting evidence that shows it to be wrong." It seems clear that even in this discussion you've decided to give answers to questions which you know will fit your accepted conclusion. You give all this talk about a new function evolving while giving no indication as to whether or not the same level of functionality was retained from the original population. I can't say I wonder why the results of the Lenski experiment have been called into question in the first place. "What's even worse about ID being scientifically vacuous? In my opinion, ID being wrong and knowing it."Sounds like a theory I know, but it isn't ID.....

creation/post_331:"It is obvious, isn't it? I hope not to be too snarky, but the Pope finally got around to admitting that Galileo was correct in teaching that the Earth revolved around the sun (get the gravity connection). With the Pope on board, whose going to argue against gravity now?"1. Can you explain what the Copernican principle (Earth around sun) has to do with gravity?2. You haven't answered my question, if Evolution (as Darwin and today's proponents describe it) is as solid a theory as gravity then why don't people who believe in gravity (that should be every sane individual) say that gravitational theory is as established as today's Neo-Darwinian synthesis? 3. If you admit that consensus has been wrong in the past are you open to the possibility that  such a scenario may be possible today?  "As simple as gravity appears, it holds deep fascination for today's scientists."Regarding this sentence and the paragraph that followed, let me say that I agree it's still a source of research, investigation, and we will never know everything as is any pillar of scientific enterprise, but I'm still wondering why Neo-Darwinian theory is compared in terms of factual confirmation to gravity but not vice versa. "How would a PhD in Theology be a failure in biology? Such a silly question. Of what use is it to know how many angels can dance on the head of a pin? Or how hard it would be for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle? There's not much work going on there. Better to know about proteins, enzymes, and how humans are related to bonobos (there is   evolution   in that)."Ivar, you've missed my point. Prior to the comment I'm replying to now, you said in the comment "Intelligent Design is a Fraud" the following:"Richards is a PhD? In what, I wonder. He would be an utter failure as a biologist."Perhaps I'm wrong, but the context I see in this line tells me you know Richards holds a doctorate degree, but you question what it may be because you insist he would be a failure in the biological sciences. My question in the comment that followed was what exactly in the following article it was that led you to conclude he would fail in the life sciences:  http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/is-intelligent-design-science  Despite your insistence that he would fail as a biologist in your comment on ID being a "fraud," I see little in the article Richards submitted that precludes solely and directly to biology. Care to explain?"Science is not a debate society where persuasion and apologetics matter. Truth always wins."I agree with the latter of that description of the scientific process, but if you're saying that debate is excluded from it's methodology then I would have to disagree. Dissent and debate are what allow science to progress in the first place, if everyone approached a field of research with the same perspective then we wouldn't be anywhere near as far as we are today. Darwin's theory would've never even gained acceptance for all that matters; people would've used the fact that it was a "fringe" view and dismissed on those grounds alone. "Religion simply is not concerned with the truth of anything."What does religion have to do with this discussion? Or to the points I originally brought up here:  http://www.opposingviews.com/comments/that-comment-was-a-fraud  For most part, I'm not sure what to say about religion or your description of it's reasoning, but if religion is to be defined solely as anything that goes against the truth, then could one argue that views in science that are later falsified (but still held by many) are essentially religion by definition?"Gays should not marry because it says so in the Bible."I'm still not sure what relevance this has to discussion over ID, but now that you brought it up I would like to say that I don't agree with such a conclusion no matter how many fundamentalists hold it to be truth. "Right. And we should have multiple wives (simultaneously, and not serially, as now practiced), and they would be men's property. That's the Bible for you, pretty messed up, don't you think?"Still don't see the relevance, but I'm assuming you're referring to a recent Newsweek article in which someone insisted the Bible holds nothing against gay marriage? I was led to my (political) views as a consequentialist, but today I have nothing against gay marriage for both utilitarian and natural rights reasons. Despite my agreement with the Newsweek article's premise, I did not agree with the reasoning behind it. I'm not sure what to say about the historical accuracy of the Bible, and I'm even less certain as to whether or not it is genuinely the word of any all-knowing supernatural being, but it definitely does not condone polygamy in any form I'm aware of:  http://www.bibletruths.net/Archives/BTAR324.htm

creation/post_345:--IslandContrary to modern and "variant interpretations" the Anthropic Principle was originally formalized by Carter as an ideological statement against the dogmatic non-scientific prejudices that scientists commonly harbor, that cause them to consciously deny anthropic relevance in the physics, so they instead tend to be willfully ignorant of just enough pertinent facts to maintain an irrational cosmological bias that leads to absurd, "Copernican-like" projections of mediocrity that contradict what is actually observed. --Let's see what we can track down via Wikipedia which is always a good start for any research--WikipediaThe phrase "anthropic principle" was coined by the theoretical astrophysicist Brandon Carter, in his contribution to a 1973 Krakw symposium honouring Copernicus's 500th birthday. Carter articulated the Anthropic Principle as a reaction to overuse of the Copernican Principle, which states that we are not at a special position in the Universe. As Carter says, "Although our situation is not necessarily central, it is inevitably privileged to some extent"The paper references isCarter, B. (1974). "Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology". IAU Symposium 63: Confrontation of Cosmological Theories with Observational Data: 291-298, Dordrecht: Reidel.So the following part of Island's claim is correct"the Anthropic Principle was originally formalized by Carter "--CarterCopernicus taught us the very sound lesson that we must not assume gratuitously that we occupy a privileged central position in the Universe. Unfortunately there has been a strong (not always subconscious) tendency to extend this to a most questionable dogma to the effect that our situation cannot be privileged in any sense. This dogma (which in its most extreme form led to the 'perfect cosmological principle' on which the steady state theory was based) is clearly untenable, as was pointed out by Dicke (Nature 192, 440, 1961), if one accepts (a) that specially favourable conditions (of temperature, chemical environment, etc.) are prerequisite for our existence, and (b) that the Universe evolves and is by no means spatially homogeneous on a local scale. --How to translate this or map this to Island's claim is more difficult. Carter points out some interesting points that the Copernican position can be taken too far, which leads to a dogmatic thinking. Rather I will approach the topic by quoting Carter--CarterMy own interest in this matter arose from reading Bondi's (1959) book Cosmology in which certain widely known 'large number coincidences' are listed as evidence justifying the introduction of various exotic theories (e.g. involving departures from normally accepted physical conservation laws) of which early examples were the 'varying G' theories of Dirac and Jordan. I am now convinced of the opposite thesis: i.e. that far from being evidence in favour of exotic theories these coincidences should rather be considered as confirming 'conventional' (General Relativistic Big Bang)  physics and cosmology which could in principle have been used to predict them all in advance of their observation. However these predictions do require the use of what may be termed the anthropic principle to the effect that what we can expect to observe must be restricted by the conditions necessary for our presence as observers. (Although our situation is not necessarily central, it is inevitably privileged to some extent.)---So on one hand Carter does warn against dogmatically applying the Copernican principle, I am not sure that the full description of Island can be found in this paper.  The anthropic statement for instance was in response to Bondi's book in which he introduced several coincidences which would required additional, exotic theories to be proposed, including departures from conservation laws. Contrary to this Carter argues that these coincidences are well in line with common scientific understanding once we accept the  anthropic principle

creation/post_352:--Having been asked to contribute a discussion of the anthropic principle for a colloquium on cosmology, I would start by recalling that although its original formulation [1] was motivated by a problem of cosmology (Diracs) and although many of its most interesting subsequent applications (such as the recent evaluation [2] of the dark energy density in the universe) have also been concerned with large scale global effects, the principle for which I introduced the term anthropic is not intrinsically cosmological, but just as relevant on small local scales as at a global level. --its original formulation was motivated by a problem of cosmology...--CarterThis presentation will not attempt to deal with the confusion that has arisen from such dissident interpretations, but will be concerned only with developments of my originally intended meaning, which I shall attempt to explain in the next section. --then--Although frequently relevant to purely local applications, the anthropic principle was originally formulated in a cosmological context as a reasonable compromise two successively fashionable extremes. The rst of these was what might be described as the autocentric principle, which underlay the pre Copernican dogma to the effect that as terrestrial observers we occupy a privileged position at the center of the universe. The opposite extreme was the more recent precept describable as the cosmological ubiquity principle, but commonly referred to just as the cosmological principle, which would haveit that the Universe is much the same everywhere, having no priviledged center, and that our own neighbourhood can be considered as a typical random sample. --

creation/post_383:How was Catastrophism closer then the original Darwinian theory?  Catastrophism offered no mechanism for the changes that we see, was completely wrong as to what catastrophes occurred,  how severe they were, and when they took place.Darwin's original theory, as put forth in "Origin of Species", has long since been supplanted by modern theories of Evolution... it was wrong with regards to many things, but Catastrophism was wrong to a greater extent then Evolution ever was.It should also be noted that once the evidence had accumulated showing that earlier theories had been wrong the Scientists changed their theories and agreed that the new interpretation was correct... when have the fundamentalists ever done so?

creation/post_415:"The random comes in when particles of RNA that came out of the primordial ooze aligned by chance in such a way to produce a single-celled organism."By the nature of their physical makeup RNA will reproduce, given the right   chemicals   near by.Experiments indicate that there were several stages between the original replicator molecules and the first cell, proto-cellular life that was able to replicate."The chances of that occuring randomly are absurdly small."Yes, in a sense.  But just because the chance is very very small does not mean that it is impossible.  It only takes one replicator molecule to start the entire process, and given the number of molecules that would have been swirling around in the ancient earths oceans it is quite possible that somewhere a replicator will form... If I roll one dice the chance of a six coming up is 1 in 6... but if I roll a thousand dice the chance that at least one will be a six is rather good."Atheists are no less violent than the religious."True... but how does that old saying go... "With or without it, you'd have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things, but for good people to do bad things, it takes   religion  .""The perception of knowledge is scary because it rules out new information. If you think or believe that something is true, you will be willing to   change   what you think/believe in light of new evidence. How can you change what you know?"That is why Science is so important.  We have to be able to test our ideas."If we know the Earth is flat, how can it be round?"The question, Scientifically speaking, is how do we know that the Earth is flat?  What tests can you run to show that the earth is flat?"If we know there is no god, how can there be a designer?"As stated above... Scientifically speaking how can we show that there is a god?Your question also presumes that there is a designer... which has not been show in a Scientifically testable manner.

creation/post_434:We may disagree as to the ability of ID proponents to explain the ultimate source of complexity. Since ID argues that complexity can only come from more complexity, the original source of the complexity found in our universe has to be caused by something even more complex, leading to the inevitable question of who designed this higher form of complexity.Claiming that "it's turtles all the way down" and that the original source of complexity has always existed is not a scientific claim.

creation/post_474:--TJ10Again, you may have faith that methodological materialism will solve all of these problems in the distant future. Great. That is your belief. However, it is nothing more than that - a belief, a stand of faith. There is no guarantee.---Sure, we may have come to realize that MN is insufficient to address all problems, however why should we conclude 'design' based on just our ignorance. Just because there are some 'scientists' who believe something more is needed, this is neither sufficient justification and worse, they have failed to provide ANY method to extend the MN framework.The supernatural without constraints is no explanation since it explains anything.Hope you realize that ID scientists are given a voice to speak. But they somehow failed to speak, or perhaps they just whispered ?Why should we give credence to just anyone who makes ill supported claims? Do we still believe in a flat earth? What about cold fusion. At least these were falsifiable claims but ID is not in the business of presenting any scientific hypotheses relevant to ID, other than negative hypotheses about Darwinian theory.I do not believe that global warming is happening should not be an excuse for ignoring the facts. If ID proponents believe MN is insufficient then let them make their case: how does one reliably detect the design of God?And why should we expect that God was somehow forced to get involved in His original design? What explanatory power does it have to say that God designed 'x'? What if we replace God with 'magic pink unicorn'? What if science discovers a way to explain it ? Does this somehow disprove 'design'? What is meant by 'design'ID's contribution is not to show that MN is lacking but rather that our scientific explanations are lacking and even there, they fail to do much relevant work.

creation/post_55:--Highlander--The exact same is true when modern science reveals an IC structure such as the flagellar motor & assembly. The absence of a plausible natural pathway means the design inference is valid. The appearance of such a pathway would falsify design.--As long as we agree that 'design' is nothing more that the claim that 'science cannot explain a particular feature or system', however then it has little relevance to intelligent design(ers). The IC claim of the flagellum is a good example of flawed reasoning. First of all, it has been shown how at least in principle IC systems can evolve, of course ID is quick to restrict IC to systems which retain their "original function" and "evolved by Darwinian processes". In other words, IC is basically the much narrower claim that certain systems could not possibly have evolved by Darwinian processes while maintaining their original function.Of course, falsifying this would at best falsify the claim of ignorance, not really the concept of design as it is more commonly understood.Clever trick...

creation/post_56:--Highlander--"I am sure that Highlander is familiar with the  foundational works of Behe and Dembski,both rely on the absence of science being  able to explain a particular feature to infer 'design'."Would that a citation exist to back this one up! --Sure, always ready to please the audience.William Demsbki. "The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance through Small Probabilities", Cambridge Studies in Probability, Induction and Decision Theory, 1998William Dembski, 'No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased without Intelligence ", Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.,  2001Irreducible Complexity is an example of Behe's formulation of 'ignorance should be called design'. In case of Behe, his biggest mistake is that he limits himself to only Darwinian processes and the concept of original function.So let me explain what the design inference is all about:The Explanatory FilterA good overview of the filter and its shortcomings can be found in Wilkins, John S, and Wesley R Elsberry. 2001. The advantages of theft over toil: the design inference and arguing from ignorance. Biology and Philosophy 16 (November):711-724.    http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/theftovertoil/theftovertoil.html    Basically the steps involve1. High probability then it was caused by a regularity2. Intermediate probability then it was caused by chance3. Small probability: either chance or design depending on the existence of a "specification"Specification is a somewhat tricky concept but according to Dembski, function in biology would be a sufficient specification. Ironically, function is also the outcome of the process of natural selection and thus whether the low probability score was caused by our ignorance or because of design is why the design inference remains without content, in case of rarefied design.Rarefied design: Rarefied design inferences tell us nothing that can be inductively generalized.The authors observe "There is an in-principle difference between rarefied and ordinary design inferences, based on the background knowledge available about ordinary, but not rarefied, design agencies."This is an important observation because it helps us understand why historical sciences can accurately apply 'design inferences' while ID remains scientifically without content.

creation/post_577:Where did I say that???It was Livvy that originally said it.Or convection currents, or towards the earth's core, or.... shoot, seems like anything is tried these days. I for one would like to know how such hypothesis could be falsified.By demonstrating an alternative process would be a good start.  A comprehensive theory of how life began on earth has not yet been developed (though there is a great deal of promising research in that direction).  Once experiments showing the very beginnings of life then a full and falsifiable theory can be developed, but we are still very much in the hypothesis stage.  One could ask how a theory involving an intelligent designer could similarly be falsifiable. I think even the most uneducated person in this debate can look up the following:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegelman_Monster    From the above link:"In 1997, Eigen and Oehlenschlager showed that the Spiegelman monster eventually becomes even shorter, containing only 48 or 54 nucleotides, which are simply the binding sites for the reproducing enzyme RNA replicase[2]."That was over ten years ago relating to one form of RNA.  More recent research seems to imply otherwise (Powner MW, Gerland B, Sutherland JD (May 2009). "Synthesis of activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides in prebiotically plausible   conditions  ". Nature 459 (7244): 23942)Doesn't sound hopeful to me, especially when the most ideal conditions require some "help:"  http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/02/origin_of_life_researchers_int.html    And since you cannot synthesis all the necessary   chemicals   in the same place or get a replicating cycle started:  www.arn.org/docs/odesign/od171/rnaworld171.htm      www.arn.org/docs/odesign/od171/ribo171.htm   Complete laterLooks like you have some explaining to do, especially when the most causally adequate explanation to date is intelligent intervention.How is intelligent intervention adequate?  It assumes the existence of something that has never been demonstrated to exists, where as the mechanisms behind   evolution   are observable today.

creation/post_596:--Jim---1. You never responded to my comment: When Crick said molecular machines appear designed but are not, he was never castigated for being "unscientific." If some one responds and says those molecular machines are designed, they are harshly criticized for being "unscientific." Why?---Likely because when Crick said it, he had positive hypotheses about how such molecular machines had arisen. And indeed, looking at the genetic evidence it shows, as expected a nested hierarchy. When people say that it looks 'designed' and is 'designed' none of these people presents anything more that just that statement. And for good reasons because ID really cannot say more than that as it is based on an eliminative/negative argument.PS: I am not sure what Crick said when or where. I have tracked down one of Crick's statements to ID proponents' writings---"Biologists must constantly keep in mind that what they see was not designed, but rather evolved." --Source: William A. Dembski "Detecting Design in the Natural Sciences"The source of the original Crick claim appears to be ""What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery," [1988], Penguin Books: London, 1990, reprint, p.138" and I will have to double check the context.--Jim---2. You write ID is merely a negative argument. I don't know about that (Luskin's article) but is it not normal in scientific discourse to point out the weakness of a theory and then argue against it on the failure to explain away the weakness?---this is what I call bait and switch or moving the goalposts. When pointing out that ID is vacuous, you state, but well, it keeps science honest. If that were the full extent of ID, then there seems to be no need to get ID pushed into are school curricula, nor would it really add anything to science as this is, as you point out what science already does. Things get worse however, when said 'arguments' against evolutionary theory are based on fallacious, misleading or outright false claims. So even in this aspect I have found ID to be lacking scientific relevance. The real issue of course is that ID proposes nothing beyond 'well science cannot explain 'x' yet'. So what... Why the attempt to call this 'design' and then use bait and switch to conflate the narrow definition of 'design' with how people commonly understand 'design'. That's too Rovian for me... If the full extent of ID is that it remains 'critical of science' then you would have to agree with me that this renders ID scientifically without content, as it fails to contribute any knowledge to science, other than point out that science does not yet explain 'x'. Look at the bacterial flagella for instance, what has science done to increase our understanding of the flagella versus what has ID done? I can tell you that science has increased our understanding significantly and has proposed, tentative hypotheses. What has ID done? Deny the relevance of the work of these scientists.to be continued

creation/post_625:oi6b>>"Open your mind and your brains will fall out."What value brains without mind?sologos>>"There is more than naturalism can engage."oi6b>>"And that's why it's called "supernatural". But there can never be any evidence that the supernatural actually affects reality." This absolute statement is an  excellent illustration of the mistake some naturalists make. Naturalism believes that by ridding itself of supernatural belief, it thereby becomes neutral, rendering its findings objective. Whenever naturalism goes beyond its methodology, it becomes an ideology, not unlike religion. This statement is a belief. oi6b>>"You wish to change the definition of "science" to include the "metaphysical"? That's silly. The word "philosophy" comes to mind, but it's not science."Science, it appears as many definitions. I like the original meaning, "knowledge". The experimental method is merely one of its methodologies. It works well, but it requires further refinements if it is to become a tool to discern "knowledge".  sologos>>"get at the core issue of intelligence operative within them both"oi6b>>"Your assertion is not supported by any evidence."Only in the same sense that there is no evidence to the contrary. Unless of course there is no such thing as intelligence.  sologos>>"God simply allows us"oi6b>>"Your assertion is not supported by any evidence."Which assertion, God, or God allows. If you don't accept the first I am powerless to change your denial.sologos>>"I would hardly call what the NCSE puts out as neutral in the matter of public relations."oi6b>>"Of course not - they are on the side of science, not religion."So non-neutrality is a good thing? oi6b>>"Riiiight. And how can science do more to "address" its limitations, than by simply admitting them? Science is "materialistic" and perhaps that's a "limitation" and science admits it and you wish to change this in some way?"Your first question is a good one. I believe that we are attempting to answer that very challenge, mostly prompted, curiously, by the incursion of naturalism into areas it is not yet honed to address. It's a healthy backlash though.  As to your second question, I believe you meant to say that MN is materialistic.oi6b>>"Nonsense. Science is the process. How do you wish to "refine" the process of science?"rScience HAS processes that have continually been in evolution since its inception.

creation/post_676:--You can't offer anymore than theory for one or the other. I just believe that an open mind is far more important than only one view that can not be proven.--On the contrary, I could fill countless books to support the Darwinian and evolutionary theories while the ID 'theory' can be summarized as 'I do not understand: thus poof'--As for Darwin, have you read his books or are just brain washed into thinking that science is always right. Cattle follow the leader without questioning the direction.--I have read most of his books and even some of his unpublished manuscripts. Furthermore, Darwinism as it exists today is strengthened by a vast amount of additional knowledge not originally accessible to Darwin.--I don't know the answer. However, I keep an open mind.--No you don't. You have not studied evolutionary theory which you so foolishly describe as lacking evidence.-- And he was a racist. Read before you go up to call out the big boys. If you don't see the racist in his works than I feel sorry for you.--Note the lack of evidence and the name calling. All clear evidence of a lack of argument.Well done, purelabor but you surely can do better than this now can you? Or are you unable to support even your more outrageous claims?I do understand, that's the most commonly observed modus operandus of ID proponents.Don't feel sorry for me, present an argument, surprise us, enlighten us, thrill us with your arguments.

creation/post_681:I know this sounds crazy, but in a weird way I'm honored to get a response from you. Is there any chance you could somehow send me the original drafts through email or something? I'm just curious to see the notorious "cdesignproponentists" (or however the hell they misspelled it) in the way it was originally used. Does the NCSE have photocopies or PDF files of the early drafts for download? I'll give you my email if needed.But seeing that you obtained the drafts do you also happen to have a personal set of early drafts from back when Pandas was under a wide variety of different titles (including "creation biology" or something to that effect)?

creation/post_745:So you're saying that because it is written in the Bible that God created the universe in the manner described, then it must be true? I don't even know where to begin on this one. That kind of logic is not really going to cut it with any logical individual, Christian or not. Here are a couple of reasons why:1) The Bible has been translated and retranslated over and over again and been reinterpreted (and in some cases completely rewritten) perhaps thousands of times along the way.along the way so it's beyond question that it has changed in it's original message2) The level of knowledge exhibited by the ancients who wrote the Bible is far removed from our knowledge today, which implies that their view may be less than perfect. Amongst other things, they believed that the earth was flat.3) No one even knows who wrote Genesis. I fail to see why they should be taken as... ahem... gospel.4) Everything word written in Genesis is beyond ridiculous. For example the passage: "then God said "Let there be light!"." which is quite strange really as it was before he created the sun, moon and stars.I could go on but I think I've made my point.

creation/post_75:In a recent article, Casey Luskin addresses the recent findings that changes in a regulatory gene can help explain the morphological differences between the chimpansee and humans.Luskin however continues the somewhat ignorant statement that this shows how junk dna is not always junk. However, what Luskin does not tell you is that 1) Junk dna was introduced to describe initially pseudogenes etc 2) that regulatory genes were in fact already recognized and never considered junk 3) that said 'regulatory' genes are well conserved and under strong selection.In other words, these findings strengthen, not weaken the argument. Furthermore, the research shows a change of I believe 18 nucleotides out of 80 or so, responsible for the regulation.In fact, early papers had already pointed out that much of the morphological differences between chimps and humans are likely due to regulatory gene changes.Now I understand that Luskin, who is a lawyer, may have been confused by how the popular press portrayed the findings but since he works for an organization which claims its goals are to correct errors in reporting, one would have hoped that Luskin would have quoted from the original research rather than from popular press.Prabhakar S and 9 others. 2008. Human-specific gain of function in a developmental enhancer. Science 321:1346 - 1350. doi:10.1126/science.1159974Wray GA, Babbitt CC. 2008. Enhancing gene regulation. Science 321:1300-1301. doi:10.1126/science.1163568And for those wondering how ID explains these findings, of course, it doesn't, it does not deal in answering such 'pathetic questions', just ask Dembski.

creation/post_77:All too often the terms of this debate don't get defined.  It's hard to know what is being debated when readers don't know what the NCSE, ARI or AU mean when they say evolution, or when they refer to intelligent design.  Specifically, when defining intelligent design it's important to note that what is most often reported in the media is NOT in any way a definition of the theory that ID proponents subscribe too.  You usually see something along the lines of "life is so complicated it must have been designed by a higher power."  That is not at all how the leading proponents of ID describe the theory.  That is how critics like the NCSE or ACLU describe theory. According to the theory of intelligent design, certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.  This definition can be found at:     www.intelligentdesign.org/whatisid.php    .Scientist who support intelligent design seek evidence of design in nature, and argue that such evidence points to intelligent design, based on our historical knowledge of cause and effect. Intelligent design theorists argue in favor of design theory based on the recognition of things like the rich digital information in DNA and the complex molecular machines found in cells. They do so because invariably we know from experience that complex systems possessing such features always arise from intelligent causes.  For instance, the DNA molecule is embedded with an immense amount of information.  In our uniform and repeated experience, information only comes from minds (read: intelligence).  So why should we attribute the information in DNA to a mindless process like Darwinian evolution?  ID scientists think we should not.  Obviously, ID is an inference from the evidence, not from religious scriptures or practices.So, intelligent design theory is not an argument based on what we dont know, but rather an argument from what we do know.Defining what biological evolution is:There are three simple, but very different definitions of biological evolution.  When speaking with people about the issue it is important to ask them which definition of evolution they are using. 1)  Change over time (even billions of years, most leading ID proponents believe the universe is billions of years old)2)  Common ancestry, all forms of life evolved from a single original life form3)  Natural selection acting on random mutation is the primary mechanism by which life forms have evolved.ID scientists do not have a problem with definition #1.  There is some debate over definition #2, but it is not incompatible with ID.  Definition #3, commonly referred to as Darwinian Evolution, is a specific part of evolution that ID challenges and is the heart of Darwins theory.   Be sure you know what people mean when they say evolution.Intelligent design is not the same as creationism. Creationism is usually defined by these tenets: The universe, energy and life were created from nothing.  The earth is young, in the range of 6,000 to 10,000 years.  Earth's geology can be explained by catastrophic events, primarily a worldwide flood. Mutations and natural selection cannot bring about the development of all living things from a single organism.

creation/post_776:The Bible is no more self authenticating then any other irrational fantasy.The whole idea of a creator, and a moment if creation is flawed:"Some foolish men declare that a Creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill-advised, and should be rejected. If God created the world, where was he before creation?... How could God have made the world without any raw material? If you say He made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression... Know that the world is uncreated, as time itself is, without beginning and end. And it is based on principles."Mahapurana by JinasenaEden as a paradise.  Sounds like a maximum security prison with all pervasive surveillance.And, obscenity of obscenities, original sin.  Were Adam & Eve zombies ? since without free will they were not human:"To hold man's nature as his sin is a mockery of nature. To punish him for a crime he committed before he was born is a mockery of justice. To hold him guilty in a matter where no innocence exists is a mockery of reason. To destroy morality, nature, justice and reason by means of a single concept is a feat of evil hardly to be matched." (Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged)"There must be some way that the human race can rid itself of the scourge of religion.

creation/post_784:My answers to your questions are: 1. Why does it matter; NO; and NO. 2. NO.It is the third No that I find most interesting.  You freely admit that you cannot defend your position without the Bible, but are in a discussion with those who do not believe that the Bible is a valid source in scientific matters.  If a religious source that cannot be supported otherwise is valid to you then what would you say to a Taoist that supports their arguments by relying on their holy texts?If a man (or woman) says that he loves God and believes in Him as the Center of his life, then he will not have any problem using that book to help him support his viewpoint.This is all well and good when talking among other   Christians  , but it comes across as God did it when talking with those outside of Christiantiy.  If I said that the sun was carried across the sky in Apollos chariot what would you say?By the way, the Vatican was not the only branch of Christianity to select Biblical Books and support a particular viewpoint, some Protestant denominations were also guilty of deciding which Books would remain in the Bible nearly four centuries ago.So who has the correct collection of books?As far as evidence to show that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God, you need look no further than the Bible itself.If and only if you already accept the Bible as true is this a valid statement it does not follow if you do not already accept the original statement that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God.Since God cannot lie, why then, would the Word of God tell lies?The Flying Spaghetti Monster does not lie, we know this because the book describing the FSM says so and since the FSM does not lie then the book is true.

creation/post_834:Human beings added names to the days of week, they were originally and simply numbers.  The first day, the second day, the third day, and so forth.  No, God did not place elements of idolatry into His days (or anything else, for that matter).  I believe that when people take out the supernatural aspect of this issue, then we might as well give all the credit to men, many of whom always seem to know more than our Heavenly Father.   I say let's stop trying to rationalize everything in God's creations and allow Him some of the honor.

creation/post_851:With all due respects, here is my Bottom Line, though I run the risk of being arrogan and "closed-minded," I only write for the Judeo-Christian World View.  This is mainly due to a time-factor...I only have one life on Earth in which to learn.  Therefore, I don't have time to explore any other world views because there is still so much for me to learn from this one.Your point is well-taken.  My applied logic only works for those who see the world as I do...However, I will address a couple of your concerns.First, since it is impossible for God to sin, God would never be deceptive.  Yet, THAT once given, we may now turn our attention to humans who do something similar.  It is openly taught on HGTV!It's the creation of faux surfaces, like faux rust and faux marble.  For our discussion faux rust is the most germaine.  These artists create rust and various apparently aged surfaces through chemical processes that could be expected to leave various types of residue.If The LORD chose to do something, like that, He could do an infinitely better job than we humans can.My point in my original comment was not to state some superior knowledge, but to explore a probable hypothesis that explains logically (at least to my mind) how the world works.Thanks for just a little room for letting a guy "think out-loud."  :)

creation/post_854:Speaking as a non-Christian, this argument that the days of creation could not be allegorical simply because the author used an ordinal and the phrase "evening and morning" is juvenile and unconvincing. Furthermore, big bang cosmology is not a necessary component of evolutionary theory in the Darwinian sense, yet AiG continues to conflate the two, much to the frustration of anyone who understands the difference.If the fossil record isn't what it appears to be and AiG can demonstrate it, the scientists will listen. AiG should publish a compelling alternative hypothesis that better explains all observations. If the fossil record and all the death therein was indeed deposited within human history, why are there no mammals except the upper layers? How did layers of denser rock form above layers of light rock? These are just two of many very real and easily verifiable observations that traditional geology and evolutionary theory explains better than AiG geology.This left me wondering about the motivation of organizations like AiG. Are they reaching out to non-Christians? If so, these childish arguments are the wrong approach. Are they defending cherished beliefs in the face of more progressive believers? If so, AiG needs to pick their battles more wisely. The evidence for an ancient earth is overwhelming. Everyone should be willing to accept the possibility that a cherished belief like "original sin" may be superfluous, unnecessary, and incorrect.

creation/post_897:If scientific inquiry has shown conclusively that Genesis is at best allegorical, then Christians should reconsider beliefs that presume a historical interpretation of Eden.Doctrines like original sin, substitutionary atonement, and the trinity are not described anywhere in the Bible. They're merely theories that theologians have created to make sense of the narrative. Much like a scientific theory, theology should be questioned if it contradicts new discoveries. It's time to rethink your particular theology if you find it in conflict with the conclusions of scientists, whose theories are much easier to conclusively test and verify.Despite what you say, the Bible makes sense even to me, an atheist. The Bible as ancient folklore can teach us a great deal about ancient Hebrew society: their fears, their dreams, their iconic heroes, and their perception of the world. A document does not need to be a perfectly preserved dictation from the mouth of god to be useful.

creation/post_898:Doctrines such as: original sin, substitutionary atonement, and the trinity are very well described in the Bible. It's actually not too hard to piece together if you read scripture as a "whole" since it is supposed to be about God and his will for this earth. Evolution is merely a theory at best, and has more holes than swiss cheese ;). It is made to seem like it is "irrefutable," but that is not the case. It is actually "forced" to be taught in schools as fact, although it is only the closest science can come to explaining the origin of human existence and how things developed over time. What's more controversial is the other "separate" theory, which I have no idea why its separate, the "Origin of Life." That theory is so flawed that it has to be kept a separate theory, to make evolution seem "credible." If you would like to discuss the trinity or etc, feel free to let me know. It's best to look at both sides like I have, not just one "presupposed" attitude towards the other. So would you say that the those in the bible "lied" about Jesus doing miracles, and God showing himself through signs or etc. Because that doesn't exactly represent how they acted: Jesus followers were promoting honesty, truth, forgiveness, etc... and they died because of what they saw and believed in. It would seem crazy that they would just make things up, and die for thier beliefs... doesn't it. Just doesn't work logically with your theory.
creation/post_899:#originalStanceText=No
creation/post_899:#originalTopic=was-the-world-created-in-six-days
creation/post_899:First of all, I have no "presupposed attitude." I was a young earth creationist like yourself when I was first introduced to these issues. If anything, that was my presupposed attitude, and it took years for me to overcome it. If you think original sin, substitutionary atonement, and the trinity are obvious when reading the scripture "as a whole," then I highly suggest that you read the works of Christians who would disagree with you. I particularly enjoyed Tom Harpur.I don't know how better to state this: The theory of evolution is the most extensively verified theory of science outside the mathematical precision of physics. No other theory has the same extent of converging, collaborative evidence from such a diversity of scientific disciplines over the past century. Paleontology, anatomy, biochemistry, genetics, medicine, psychology, sociology, geology, astronomy, and even computer science are just a few examples of the fields independently producing volumes of observations that validate the theory of evolution.As an example, consider human retroviruses. An endogenous retrovirus is a virus that infects gametes and becomes part of the genetic makeup of a species. These fragments of DNA make up about eight percent of the human genetic code, and thousands of them are in the exact same locations in chimpanzees. If chimpanzees and humans were created separately then the probability that the same viruses would infect the same locations in our genetic codes is near impossible. The only two viable explanations are that (1) we share a common ancestral population with chimpanzees or (2) the creator pre-infected both species with the same viruses in the same genetic locations. Is the second explanation compatible with your god or your notion of original sin?   http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/03/071203fa_fact_specter   That is just one example of thousands from genetics alone that validate the theory of evolution. Evolution is not irrefutable, but it has an incalculably high probability of being correct based on our observations. There is no controversy among professionals: evolution happened. The only disagreement that still exist are over the details.Ambiogenesis is a separate theory because Darwin's theory never dealt with the first life. His theory presupposed the existence of life to explain the development of biodiversity. God may have created the first life, and the theory of evolution would still be correct. Ambiogenesis is an area of ongoing research complicated by the fact that the earliest life did not fossilize, but it appears increasingly likely that the earliest self-replicating molecules formed naturally. Most of the molecules required by the simplest cells are naturally occurring.You suggested a conspiracy theory to force the theory of evolution into schools. There are thousands of scientists all over the globe from every creed, ethnicity, and nation relying upon the theory in their daily work. To suggest that all these individuals are complicit in a global conspiracy to force the theory onto school children is ludicrous. If evolution were indeed a lie, the whistle blower who could explain exactly how the theory is flawed would become a household name overnight. She would have more grant money than she could spend. In such a competitive profession, why hasn't this happened?

creation/post_906:Yes, I understand we didn't evolve from chimps from the position of   evolution   theory - and I'm sorry for saying it that way considering I truly don't want to encourage the misinformation and typical uninformed view. You never addressed any of the sea anemone info.. my point is - if we have a 'common ancestor' the more we look at the info.. the only common ancestor we could have is an amoeba - and we would have lost common ancestry at that point.  Why? Because of the cambrian explosion - which shows that at one moment (5 million years or so) nearly every phylum appeared.'Geologically speaking, 5 million years represents a mere 0.11 percent of Earthshistory. As Chinese paleontologist Jun-Yuan Chen has explained, compared with the 3-plus-billion-year history of life on earth, the period [of the explosion] can be likened to one minute in 24 hours of one day.''''Cambrian rocks display about half (or more) of the basic body plans or architectural designs of theanimal kingdom.''''Representatives of nineteen of the forty known animal phyla definitely make their first appearance in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion. Three phyla appear in the Precambrian. Six animal phyla first appear in the fossil record after the Cambrian period, and twelve more are notrepresented in the fossil record.'' and my sidenote:  Keep in mind that the six phyla that appear 'after' the cambrian could always be moved earlier in the record if we find earlier examples... This is the failure of fossils. - for example.. if I find a cat skeleton in the earth... It only tells me that they existed in this form at that time... it doesn't tell me that they didn't exist in that form EARLIER in the record..  Though we have found that roughly half of the phyla and many subphyla first appeared in the cambrian - that doesn't rule out that all of the phyla could with further research be proven to appear in this 5 million year period.  A mere 6 phyla are currently shown to not...this concept is also stated in the paper as:'many paleontologists think that almost all of these additional eighteen phyla may well have originated during the Cambrian explosion. As Valentine, Jablonski, and Erwin argue, All livingphyla may have originated by the end of the [Cambrian] explosion.There are no transitional fossils leading up to these phylum -  a slightly exaggerated time line might appear like this:3 billion + years --) singe cell lifeforms / agae 530 million years ago --) possibly every other family of animal and plant.But this is only the original family... right? These creatures were possibly just very simple forms - so what's it matter?.... not at all.  Let's take the example of Haikouella lancelota According to Chen and his colleagues, Haikouella has many of the same features of the Yunnanozoon lividum, as well as several additional anatomical features including a heart, ventraland dorsal aorta, an anterior branchial arterial, gill filaments, a caudal projection, a neural cord with a relatively large brain, a head with possible lateral eyes, and a ventrally situated buccal cavity with short tentacles.Many of these phyla were in the same form as they are now seen.. in other words - they appear in the record.. with no transition up - and make no further adaptations.  Many like Haikouella are extinct.This does not support evolution.. it supports some form of scientifically unexplainable creation - it implies drastic immediate change that brings about every animal and plant family.. with no sign of transition - and then relatively low amounts of change afterward.  the only thing left that disagrees with creation is the time line - which I feel is questionable due to the methods of extrapolation since it is built on assumptions.

gayRights/post_1113:Ever heard of separation of church and state? It was originally made to keep the state out of the church... No religious institution should be forced to do anything. Religious institutions are supposed to be houses of freedom from cynical, politically correct, immoral, and oppressive natures of society (and i'm not saying this because i'm a regular church-goer. I haven't been to church in months). If a religious institution chooses not to recognize a same-sex marriage, or anything else for that matter, more power to them!

gayRights/post_1121:Otherwise I would be arguing the apparent, but not true, reason for the assertion. To directly refute the assertion - no, homosexuality is not unnatural. It occurs across all cultures, geographies and throughout the history of mankind not to mention in other species of animals. President Ahmenijad of Iran was publicly laughed at when he claimed his country has no homosexuals. By definition since it occurs in nature it is not unnatural. That's a much less interesting response, in my mind, than my original posting.My argument is that this whole line of debate is a manufactured topic employed by politicians who force their opponents into an argument that's irrelevant to most people but so emotionally charged that it attracts attention away from more important topics. It's a very useful tactic for a politician who could not win on the issues with an opponent but knows how to manipulate the electorate for a win. It should be called out as such to push it aside in political debate and make room for more important issues.

gayRights/post_1206:Where did   the law   come from?  I don't know, and I appreciate your thoughtful explanation, but you have made a large number of assumptions in your argument.  Unfortunately, my profound skepticism and love for the truth prevents me from accepting your assumptions outright without any evidence or explanation of why you think it's safe to make them.  So if you truly want to convince me, and I honestly am open-minded, you will need to give me some more information about these assumptions.  For clarity's sake, I will go through each of your paragraphs in order and ask questions where I need more clarification.  1.  First of all, I was not aware that the concept of marriage would not exist without   religion  .  Can you please give me some more information about which religion invented the concept of marriage, or perhaps point me in the direction of where you learned this?  I have not learned this in my studies, which admittedly have not been exhaustive.  As for birth rates, I am familiar about the low birth rates in some countries, but I do not see what that has to do with gay marriage.  If I had to guess, I would think that you mean to say that countries that are less religious have fewer   children  , but I do not see how that relates to the legality of gay marriage.  Remember, this debate is about whether gay marriage should be   legal  , not about religious views on gay marriage.  If you want to argue that laws should be based on religion you are welcome to do so, but I'm not a huge fan of theocracy myself.  I am a huge fan of the US Constitution, personally.  2.  I am not familiar with the shocking violation of   religious freedom   that you mention here, and would like to read more about it.  Could you provide a little more detail so I can do some research?  Names of the agencies involved, name of a court case, which state/time period... any of these things would help me to find more detail about the cases involved.  3.  "Confusing children at an early age as to whether they should marry a boy or a girl is not good for children still in the development stages."  In this statement you have assumed two things a) if it is legal for homosexuals to marry, children will be confused about who they want to marry, and b) such confusion is harmful to the child in a way that you did not specify.  This may be correct, but again I have not seen the evidence, could you tell me where I could read more about these claims?  "Claiming that it doesn't matter whether a child marries a boy or a girl is equivalent to   society   saying that girls are the SAME as boys."  Here, you have inadvertantly committed a logical fallacy.  The two claims are not equivalent.  Here, I'll show you:  "It doesn't matter if a business owner is a woman or a man.  Therefore, women and men are the same."  The two are not equivalent.  If you think they are, do you mean to suggest that women should not be allowed to own small businesses?  Of course not, you made no such claim because the scientific that men and women are not biologically identical is not the same thing as a society standard about what men and women should or should not be allowed to do.  4.  I'm sorry, I did not say that changes in societal attitudes are required.  I do not think that I have the right to dictate what others are allowed to believe.  I do have personal standards which differ from the most common societal views, but I do not really feel compelled to demand that others change their views to be like me.  As much as I'd love for us to agree about something :)  Your notion that something being legal means that society "endorses" it confuses me, if you care to clarify this position I'd love to hear it.  And the rest of this paragraph appears to be your complaints about   adoption     law  .  As I mentioned in my original post, if you think the adoption laws should be changed, then you're in the wrong place.  This debate is about whether homosexual couples should be allowed to get married, not about whether they should be allowed to adopt children.  If you feel that's a problem, why aren't you against gay adoption?  Why gay marriage?  And finally, it's great that you care about the rights of children, but all children do have a mother and father, as far as I know... maybe I missed human cloning coming into vogue?  I think you mean to say that you think all children have the right to be raised the way that you think is most appropriate.  Do you also feel that we should enact laws dictating how parents are allowed to raise children?  It's fine with me if you do, I'm just trying to understand your argument.  (this was too long, so there will be a part 2)

gayRights/post_1266:"Homosexuality is a lifestyle choice, not innate and not a civil right."If anything, this is the red herring. The point I bring up when I invoke Dred Scott v. Sandford is that Justice Traney and the Justices that followed him used flat-out originalist thinking when forming their opinion. They -didn't care about justice- at all. They cared about what the founding fathers (allegedly) thought about, and nothing else. All I said was that originalist viewpoints cannot stand on their own.Homosexuality being a choice is irrelevant to discussion.Personal appeals are irrelevant to law.Are you about to tell me not only (1) that your experience is more valuable than someone else's, and (2) that we should all follow your opinion? Perhaps I think being a   vegetarian   is more healthy than eating   meat  , yet I'm not about to pose the same standards upon you.

gayRights/post_1268:Again, I'm not equating African-American   civil rights   to   homosexual   civil rights. I'm just opposing originalist thinking."And when the government steps in and requires me to become a   vegetarian   like you, will you stand with me in opposition to that intrusion?"I will. Because individuals should have the   right to choose   their lifestyles so long as it doesn't disrupt another person's life, liberty, property, or pursuit of happiness. Until it can logically and empirically be shown that non-  vegetarianism   directly harms another individual, and that that harm is great enough to warrant government intrusion, I would never find it fit for a government to coerce people into becoming   vegetarians  .Similarly, I would never find it fit for a government to coerce people into becoming heterosexual. THIS is the point I'm making.

gayRights/post_1413:Before I begin, the following reminder is in order :In biology, evolution is change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. These changes are caused by a combination of three main processes: variation, reproduction, and natural selection. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EvolutionI suppose your reply is an attempt to rebut my assertions: "Bare in mind that homosexuals that adhere to the theory of evolution must also necessarily adhere to the principle of the theory which posits the propagation of the fittest sexually reproductive species; and consequently has damned the homosexual, for the homosexual doesn't propagate its species."; And that your reply is in favor of: "Homosexuals do not pass on their genes directly, however many studies have shown that they may make reproduction more likely for their siblings. In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. In addition, studies with humans have shown that those people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual.The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective. Evolution works on helping the individual survive, however in those organisms that reproduce sexually, species evolve in groups. Therefore any characteristic that allows the group to survive will be passed on. There is no definitive proof that homosexuality is one of these characteristics, but the possibility is a strong one.My response:Consider the consequences of supporting the oppositions argument.If homosexuality is a consequence of evolution and such a consequence is for the purpose of the survival of a species; how does homosexuality benefit the survival of a group of its species? We can immediately infer that evolution has removed the homosexual from genetically contributing to its own species. And thus, the genetics of the homosexual are not conducive to the survival of the species, but are destructive of the survival of the species. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Evolution excludes certain individuals from genetic contribution to its species through homosexuality for the survival of the group for the survival of the species. Furthermore, evolution has eliminated certain genetic consequences from genetically multiplying with members of its own species.We can also infer that all groups of species are beneficiaries of the homosexuality of the individuals of their group. Is the author implying that in order for sexual reproduction to propagate the species more effectively, certain individuals must be homosexual so that others will not be homosexual? The author invalidly reasons: In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the (human) population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.Either the author is attempting to insult the intelligence of the audience of this debate or is guilty of granting that which is unreasonable. (I dont think the author intentionally does either one, but unintentionally accomplishes both.) If we were to reason according to the example by the author we can arrive at some very interesting conclusions. For example:The prevalence of inbreeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that inbreeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.The prevalence of cannibalism in other species makes it fairly obvious that cannibalism among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.The prevalence of random breeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that random breeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.The prevalence of vomit consumption in other species makes it fairly obvious that the consumption of vomit among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.The prevalence of butt-licking in other species makes it fairly obvious that butt-licking among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. Just because certain things are true of many other species doesnt allow any man or woman to validly infer the same is true of another species. This is called in layman terms: jumping to conclusions.  If you were to reread and carefully consider the assertions of my original argument as re-posted above, you will see that the assertions are subjective on the behalf of the proponents of evolution. The propositions only indicate the inescapable conclusions that the theory supports. I did not assert that the theory of evolution accounts for all that is known of the processes of lifes continuity. Nor did I suggest one should embrace the theory.  I have simplistically explained some of the consequences of some of the supposed complexity of the theory of evolution. And by doing such, I have demonstrated that wherein I reference evolution, I can reduce the supposed complexity of that subject of the theory of evolution to its simple illogical conclusions. And for this reason I am not troubled by an accusation that I view evolution simplistically. (Albeit, my argument is particular, yet I was accused of an universal argument.) Another issue that I must address, before I am accused of neglecting it, is the matter of social contributions made by homosexuals, both tangible and intellectual. Whether a homosexual or any other person has made any tangible or intellectual contribution that enabled/s the survival of a species is purely fallacious. Speculations of what one person has or has not done that conclusively contributed to the survival or destruction of a species are of the fallacy, argumentum ad speculum. We can indefinitely speculate by hypothetical reasoning that which may have been or should have been. Yet, until there is conclusive evidence that would lend itself to the scrutiny of sound reasoning that concludes that any member, or group of any species is a necessary cause or consequence of/for the survival or death of a species, we should not speculate that it is obvious. Can we speculate that we would be ignorant of the law of gravity if Kepler and Newton were never born? Can we speculate that we are alive today because of that knowledge? Yes, we can speculate about anything, but we cannot rationally speculate unto a definitive conclusion that is reasonably useful.One last thing before I end this rebuttal; my rebuttals explain the wherefore of my propositions. Your rebuttals on the other hand evidence nothing that supports your argument. Your arguments seem to always come in the form of either a straw-man, ad hominem, or red-herring fallacy. In fact, there is no argument in your rebuttals. You simply assert whatever you think is ad populum. A little advice: if you are unwillingly to take the time to support your case, I suggest that you forego rebutting the arguments of someone who will take the time. However, I welcome your legitimate attempts to support your views that are contrary or contradictory to my arguments.

gayRights/post_1553:I think I may have deserved the downvote because I did not organize my last argument very effectively. Instead of getting into a long draw out thing this time, I am going to go back to my original intention.What I was referring to as bigotry was ignoring certain facts. In this case I was talking about JakeJ, because he repeatedly claimed that homosexuality was a choice, and I repeatedly showed him the proof that it wasn't. JakeJ, and most other people opposed to gay marriage don't use your argument but instead make baseless claims (i.e. kids can be turned gay, or gay parents can't raise children). When these things have been proven scientifically, continuing to use the same arguments is dishonest. I know that, in probably less then 50 years, the people who opposed allowing gays their rights will be considered bigots, for better or worse, and so I therefore stand by my statements.

gayRights/post_1664:"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them." Genesis 1:27Our Lord, in His answer to the Pharisees concerning divorce, refers to this passage in Genesis and confirms its special application to marriage. "Have ye not read," He said, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female? and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."' Marriage is derived from the Lord, for male and female. It has its highest and perfect form in Him, for in Him love and wisdom are one.So how can gay marriage hurt any one? This is a very deep, complicated question and answer. (And please know, anyone that believes they are gay out there, I am not judging you. You are not horrible, and it is only my responsibility to share the truth of God's word to those who may stray from it or don't understand it.) It hurts God, don't you see? All sin does. Whenever man decides what is actually right and moral for himself, independent of God's wisdom, he always hurts himself because he has disconnected himself from God's plan for his life. And if he strays from God's plan, the course he takes can affect all of humanitylike the domino effect.I take it for certain that the physical satisfaction of homosexual desires is sin. However, this leaves the homosexual person no worse off than any heterosexual person who is, for whatever reason, prevented from marrying, or from participating in sex outside the sanctity of marriage. Or any other sin for that matter.Peopleprimarily the homosexual communitysay, "Who are others to say who we should be able to love?" (or in this case, marry) Let me ask you this: Have we not all loved our our same-sex friends as much as we've loved the opposite sex? I have loved my friends as much, sometimes more than a mate (after all, the opposite sex is oh so confusing at times!) But the difference is we do not desire to have sex with them. Ahatherein lies the heart of the controversy over homosexuality, and homosexual "marriages." You see the truth is, it's not about "love"it is about sex, and who these people desire to love, is who they desire to have sex with. I can already hear everyone saying, "So what?! Of course people want to have sex with whomever they love..." But no. Sex has been perverted and removed from its original design. First we love, then we marry, then we consummate our marriage (it is just the icing) and the marriage (the love) is preserved through commitment before God. Again, I hear folks saying "Well that's what homosexuals want to do!" First, we must understand that love begins with God. So many people misread and misuse Scripture and quote Jesus as saying, in regard to what the highest commandments are, "... to love thy neighbor as thyself..." for their arguments. But note that Jesus says, "commandmentS"plural. Immediately proceeding "love thy neighbor as thyself" He says the first and greatest commandment is "You shall love thy Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." [Following is the second greatest commandment] "Love thy neighbor as thyself." So if homosexuals reject God's teachings on love and marriage and sex, how then can they use the argument that 'they just want to be able to love whomever they want' ? They actually want to have sex with whomever they want, otherwise they would just remain the best of friends, you see? That is not the same. And then, they want to take it a step further, and sanctify it in holy marriage. This is re-writing the Bible to suit their own desires which is strictly forbidden. People may love whomever they want. They just can't have sex with whomever they want. Well, actually they CANthere is free will. Some say they were born this way. I say that in some cases this is actually true. In many cases it is a choice. But let's say they were born that way. There are alcoholics and depressed persons and naturally promiscuous persons and all kinds of burdens passed on in birththis is what's called "our cross to bare"... Sometimes we have to make the choice to sacrifice an urge or desire to sin and in turn use this struggle for the good of all. Or we can succumb to it and let the consequences fall where they may. But I'd say 98% of our population has some sort of dilemma to struggle with. Like all other tribulations, it must be offered to God for His guidance on how best to use it.And the American government has made separation of church and state very clear. They must, therefore, be consistent. The government has no right to redefine marriage in its holy context. If they stepped in and redefined marriage, a whole bunch of other decisions they've made concerning separation of church and state (removing the flag from classrooms, the commandments from courthouses, etc.) would then have to be reversed. They can't have it both ways, and they know this. Peace.

gayRights/post_1666:To respond to your first point: Your argument actually proves God's point where Jesus says there is "only way to come to the Father, and that is through the person of Jesus Christ"not Mohammed, and that those in positions of power and authority will be judged more harshly, so that may be what's going on over there? That's not saying that there aren't peaceful and loving Muslimsit's saying that a nation is being ran via Islam by it's governing powers, which, according to Scripture, brings ruin upon itself by dismissing the person and holiness of Jesus and teaching their entire people to dismiss it as well. I personally believe that a nation of authentic believers in Christ running the country would be just and free of crime, pain, suffering, etceteraoh wait, that would be Heaven. But sin is in the world and a country based on Christ's truth and faith and peace (not religion?) isn't going to happen here on earth. So we do the best we can with a democracy that guarantees protection of religion.Your second point: I know for a fact that some people DO choose to "be gay" as one of my friends is newly gay, but didn't used to be, but after one too many hurts by the opposite sex and a desperate need to be cared for decided to give the other side a try. (And it should be noted that we hear each other's views on the subject with respect and agree to disagree but are still good friends.) There's also the perfect illustration of choosing in bisexuals, who can't seem to "choose" which sex they prefer. It is a choice in the end, even if it's an inclination one is born with, as I said in my original argument. I don't even begin to know how you came to compare gay marriage to allowing someone with dyslexia to marry? Re-read my original argument about the necessity of marriage being male/female. Marriage is a holy union between a man and a womanit is not a civil union (although many treat it as such)and that is why so many people have a problem with legalizing gay marriage. It would erode the foundation and meaning of marriage according to God, which is sacred to believers. You don't want to believe in Godhey, that's between you and Him and every human being has that free choiceno one is forcing or condemning anyone. All that believers are doing is defending their faith-based, holy sacraments so that others can't redefine them when they don't even believe in them. I mean there really is a contradiction there, right? Christians don't marry for financial reasons (at least they're not supposed to) or things like thatit is to pledge the marriage to God, to request His blessing. Let me ask you something: What's wrong with homosexuality being a choice? I mean, if homosexuals are confident and proud of their sexual preference, why the need to say that the trait is inborn? Why all the shame? "Fundamentalism" is defined as a strong adherence to any set of beliefs in the face of criticism and unpopularity. I am by no means a perfect Christian, but I am trying to be an authentic Christian and not a casual one, so I guess if that makes me a fundamentalist, then I guess I am? But be careful about labeling when you so clearly and "fundamentally" adhere to your own beliefs. Diversity goes both ways my friend. ;)Oh, and Prop 8, was voted down by a democracy, not by religionthe majority deemed it not to be acceptable, to use your own words.

gayRights/post_1715:Nice try at a cut and past job, but your argument does not hold water as the analogy between interracial marriage and homosexual unions does not carry over.As I stated in my previous argument the practice of legal recognition of aspects of homosexual unions is new and unprecedented. Indeed it is unprecedented everywhere in the history of the world. This is quite unlike interracial marriage which has been practiced in many times in many places throughout history, and in most cases without any special legal opinion on the matter. Homosexual unions are different and are new in their established recognition under law.But that aside, i would point out that my original argument was addressing the issue of the curruption of language, and of the importance of preserving the long standing meaning of words, especially when there are no easy alternatives; such as in the case of the word "marriage". By attempting to broaden or slightly redefine the meaning of a word, you neccessarily dilute its original meaning.If proponents of non-sex-specific unions had rallied for civil unions, or same sex unions recognition under the law, we would not be having this conversation. What proponents of the phrase "gay marriage" demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words. And they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority. This is form of calculated aggression against long standing traditional meaning of language, and should not be tolerated by a civil society.In this Republican form of government, the minority should be protected from the majority, but the majority should also be protected from the minority. Even at their peak, the Nazis never had a majority of political affiliation, they took power as a political minority, but look what havok they wreaked upon their own citizenry and the values which they imposed by force upon the majority!When language is eroded by degrees, then it ceases to have meaning; communication, and even thought itself become impossible. And society is brought unto a state of total decay and ruin. What once were men are then little more than animals. Read a page out of Orwell's 1984. The government's new speak is double ungood.

gayRights/post_1717:Addressing your first point, of course there are modern developements in calling legally recognized relationships between same sex couples "marriage", that is why it is worth debating, whereas as little as ten or twenty years ago it was not. I was speaking in the broad scope of human history, and in that great span, this misapplication of the more traditional term of "marriage" to some form of relationship between a couple who are of the same sex IS new and IS unprecedented, particularly noteworthy is the use of the law as a weapon to force the new definition of the word "marriage" on everybody else against their consent in the name of equality and liberty for all.I assure you words DO have meaning, and pondering that meaning is neither "vacuous" or "pseoudo intellectual". Some of the greatest intellectuals of Western Civilization are on my side on this one. Descarte, Aristotle, Newton, poets like Shakespeare, and Thoreau (who has been speculated as being homosexual by the way) all poured over the fine nuance and meaning of the words they used. And we have benefited greatly from them.Of course the meaning of words change over time, but the underlying reality does not. Some words are reaplied to have new meaning, but the thing refered to has remaind unchanged in its underlying nature. The same bird is called by different names in different languages; and while some words may change faster than others, changing the word does not change the bird.Any culture that values its heritage will naturally want to defend that culture from uncontrolled change including its own language, and it is natural and good that it should do this it is the practice of a form of social self preservation. This may sound academic, but it is not! It is exactly what is practiced by the government in French Canadia. They censor and conrol their printed media, street signs, and advertising billboards so as to assure adherence to the standard French language in word use and spelling. This may seem outlandish to the provintial mind, but begs the question...why do they do it? Because they value their own culture.I do not venture to put myself on the side of government cencorship of all printed media, but surely our American society if it values its own cultural heritage at all, must atleast protect its language within the confines of the written law.If sufficient demand for civil unions passes the standard of civil debate and law, that is fine. But no equivelant forum exists for the passage of redefining the meaning of words. Unlike in French Canadia, there are no language police. As law is nothing but the accumulation of words, the manipulation and steady curruption of those words will lead to the destruction of those laws original meaning, either in word, or in practice as those ignorant of the past will be unable to understand the true meaning of the words as they were intended.This is not hypothetical. The Spanish conquistadors destroyed their conquered Aztec subject's written histories and records for a reason, to bring about the destruction of their civilization.As for interracial marriage, i have already addressed that issue, please read the previous post more carefully.My 1984 reference was about the ministry of Truth, which systematically corrupted the language by deminishing the number of words and broadening each remaining words application, thereby diluting its meaning. The speaker posits this is exaclty what is occuring in the case of legal use of the term "gay marriage", for the reasons stated in the primary statement.This speaker did not state "that same-sex marriage could lead to 'a state of total decay and ruin.'" The inner statement was taken out of context, see previous argument. Neither has this speaker sought to discredit same sex unions, either in principle or in law. The speaker wishes to make clear the distinction between using the word marriage in the traditional sense and in the new same-sex sense in which it is being applied. Proponents of the use of language of so called "gay marriage" would have you believe there is no difference between the two definitions, while simultaneously insisting that their new definition be accepted; which is a contradiction.

gayRights/post_1813:Why on earth would it be? Leviticus? Can you find Leviticus in the Bible if your life depended on it? Christians, I talking to YOU. Do you even know which versus even remotely pertain to homosexuality? Do you bother to even look at the original languages they were written in? Do you realize that Bibles that use the word "homosexual" are not accurate, because the word wasn't even invented until the 1890's in Germany, and didn't become part of the English language until well into the 1950's? What, God sent a revision to the editor? Are you nuts? The original language in Leviticus, by the way, is "men who are soft." You are on VERY shaky ground when trying to make this entire argument, based on original language in the Bible.Did you know that Jesus himself never said one word about homosexuality? Oh, wait, yes he did, too. Remember the story about the Centurian? No?The one recorded instance in the entire Bible where Jesus ever encountered a gay person was the Centurian story. A Roman soldier - the Centurian - calls Jesus in a crowd and asks him to heal his ill slave - specifically referring to him as his male, sex slave, his lover. (Check the original language.) Jesus' response isn't one of revulsion, but utter praise! When the Centurian says that it is not necessary for Jesus to travel to the lover to heal him, that the lover was healed simply because Jesus said he was healed, caused Jesus to exclaim to the crowd, "I have not seen this kind of faith in all of Israel!" Yes, praise for a homosexual's faith, not condemnation of who he was. Explain that.Are you telling me you are more holly than Jesus himself? If He did not judge us, why do you?And speaking of which, how come you never condemn wealth? Jesus certainly did. A third of all the words in the New Testament, and 2/3 of the words of Jesus, specifically say that the wealthy have great problems getting into heaven because their wealth keeps them from God. Yet you never, ever hear evangelicals mention that? Why? Too busy raising money and driving Mercedes?Why this fascination with homosexuality when Christ tells you take care of the poor, care for the widowed and defenseless, and stop judging? Look at the countless times he lambastes the pious religious peoples in Israel. Are you listening? He's speaking to you - I'd suggest you stop worrying about gay people and start worrying about your own plight. There are too many homeless, too many abused, too many isolated and defenseless people who go without one shred of help in this country. THOSE are the concerns of Jesus, not gay people.I dare any of you to tell me that is not the "gospel truth."

gayRights/post_1817:In the New Testament there are three passages to consider. Romans 1:21, 26, 27Revised Standard Version21 for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him...26 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural, 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men... The King James and New International versions say virtually the same thing. Romans 1:26 and 27 clearly speak of same-gender sex by both men and women, the only passage in the New Testament that does so. Rom. 1:18-32 speaks of Gentiles (heterosexuals) who could and should have known and served and given thanks to God but would not, so God gave them up and let them do whatever they wanted to do, and that resulted in degrading and shameful acts, including same-gender sex. It is almost a moot point, but Paul is not listing sins for which God will condemn anyone, he is listing sins that occur because people have forsaken Him. These are acts committed by those who have turned away from God and so become "consumed with passion." All of us recognize that those who forsake God and give themselves over to lustful living--homosexual or heterosexual--stand condemned by the Bible. This passage is talking about people who chose to forsake God.Conservative theologian Richard Hays says, "No direct appeal to Romans 1 as a source of rules about sexual conduct is possible."B-6 I Corinthians 6:9King James Version:9...Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate [malakoi], nor abusers of themselves with mankind [arsenokoitai], 10 Nor thieves..., shall inherit the kingdom of God. New International Version9...Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes [malakoi] nor homosexual offenders [arsenokoitai] 10 nor thieves...will inherit the kingdom of God.Revised Standard Version--1952 edition:9...Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals [malakoi and arsenokoitai], 10 nor thieves..., will inherit the kingdom of God.Revised Standard Version--1971 edition:9...Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor sexual perverts [malakoi and arsenokoitai], 10 nor thieves..., will inherit the kingdom of God.A comparison of how the two Greek words are translated in the different versions shows that translations often, unfortunately, become the interpretations of the translators. In I Cor. 6:9 Paul lists the types of persons who will be excluded from the kingdom of God and for some he uses the Greek words malakoi and arsenokoitai. KJ translates the first "effeminate," a word that has no necessary connection with homosexuals. The NIV translates the first "male prostitutes" and the second, "homosexual offenders". The RSV in its first edition of 1952 translated both words by the single term, "homosexuals". In the revised RSV of 1971, the translation "homosexuals" is discarded and the two Greek words are translated as "sexual perverts"; obviously the translators had concluded the earlier translation was not supportable.Malakoi literally means "soft" and is translated that way by both KJ and RSV in Matt. 11:8 and Luke 7:25. When it is used in moral contexts in Greek writings it has the meaning of morally weak; a related word, malakia, when used in moral contexts, means dissolute and occasionally refers to sexual activity but never to homosexual acts. There are at least five Greek words that specifically mean people who practice same-gender sex. Unquestionably, if Paul had meant such people, he would not have used a word that is never used to mean that in Greek writings when he had other words that were clear in that meaning. He must have meant what the word commonly means in moral contexts, "morally weak." There is no justification, most scholars agree, for translating it "homosexuals."Arsenokoitai, is not found in any extant Greek writings until the second century when it apparently means "pederast", a corrupter of boys, and the sixth century when it is used for husbands practicing anal intercourse with their wives. Again, if Paul meant people practicing same-gender sex, why didn't he use one of the common words? Some scholars think probably the second century use might come closest to Paul's intention. If so, there is no justification for translating the word as "homosexuals." Other scholars see a connection with Greek words used to refer to same-gender sex in Leviticus. If so, it is speaking of heterosexuals given to such lust they turn to such acts.Richard Hays tells us, "I Corinthians 6:9-11 states no rule to govern the conduct of Christians."B-7One commentator has another reason for rejecting the NIV and original RSV translations, "homosexuals." Today it could mean that a person who is homosexual in orientation even though "of irreproachable morals, is automatically branded as unrighteous and excluded from the kingdom of God, just as if he were the most depraved of sexual perverts."B-8So I Cor. 6:9 says nothing about homosexuality with the possible exception of condemnable pederasty.I Tim. 1:10King James Version:9...the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners,...10...for them that defile themselves with mankind (arsenokoitai)...Revised Standard Version - both 1952 and 1971 editions:9...the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for 10 immoral persons, sodomites (arsenokoitai),...New International Version:9...the law is not made for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful...10 for adulterers and perverts (arsenokoitai)Here only the RSV specifically refers to same-gender sex, using the term "sodomites," which is the translation given in both the Old Testament and New Testament to Hebrew and Greek words for male temple prostitutes. The KJV probably has the same thought. The NIV does not necessarily refer to same-gender sex. Again Paul has used the Greek word arsenokoitai, the word in I Cor. 6:9.As discussed above, this word would have no reference to homosexuality or homosexual sex in our discussion.So like the other two New Testament passages, I Tim. 1:10 says nothing about homosexuality or homosexuals and nothing about same-gender sex unless that of temple prostitutes or possibly the molestation of young boys by heterosexuals.In view of the facts set forth above, we realize there is no moral teaching in the Bible about homosexuality as we know it, including homosexual sex (except possibly pederasty). The Bible cannot be used to condemn as immoral all same-gender sex. It clearly condemns lust, whether homosexual or heterosexual. There is certainly nothing in the Bible about anyone going to hell because he or she is homosexual. All who go to hell will go for the same, one reason: failure to commit their lives in faith to Jesus Christ as their lord and savior. From a slightly different approach to interpretation, Dr. Robin Scroggs states, "The basic model in today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the New Testament that the criterion of reasonable similarity of context is not met. The conclusion I have to draw seems inevitable: Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today's debate."B-9 [Italics his] Dr. Gomes concludes his discussion of homosexuality and the Bible with these words:The Biblical writers never contemplated a form of homosexuality in which loving, monogamous, and faithful persons sought to live out the implications of the gospel with as much fidelity to it as any heterosexual believer. All they knew of homosexuality was prostitution, pederasty, lasciviousness, and exploitation. These vices, as we know, are not unknown among heterosexuals, and to define contemporary homosexuals only in these terms is a cultural slander of the highest order, reflecting not so much prejudice, which it surely does, but what the Roman Catholic Church calls "invincible ignorance," which all of the Christian piety and charity in the world can do little to conceal. The "problem," of course, is not the Bible, it is the Christians who read it.B-10

gayRights/post_276:I believe that somewhere along the way someone's emotional development can be altered or misdirected.Same sex love is fruitless and cannot multiply. There is no descendance and no future blood lineage. In the case of 2 magnets the + side reject the + side but join the - side.Do not just disreguard what I am saying lightly.It is the same with children. When I hear an adult saying: I do not like children but I love dogs or my cat is like my baby. I wander what happened in their life for them to speak that way.The issue of abandonned children is a separate subject. In any case, some studies show that when children are raised by homosexuals, the chance for them to become homosexual or bisexuals increase 7X.(from 2% to 14% of the population). We are just increasing the problem of homsexualityDo we have to create new organisations that will provide a mother or a father figure for these children like big borthers or big sister.I do no buy the idea that a lesbian will play Dad while her partner will play mom successfullyWe are just multiplying the problem for these children and the suffering that homosexuals say they endure because of their condition.Still in order to satisfy your request for me to answer your question, I like to say the following.I do no know the specific data but I hear that 500,000 children are in the family services' care.250,000 or more are still connected to their original families and half of the 250,000 left are not small babies but are more dificult to adopt because they are older or have been abused or hurt in some fashion.The answer is to raise the consciousness of the whole country on this issue big time and mobilise all the goodness in the USA to tackle this problem.Most people are not aware of it.Instead of adopting children, people with same sex attraction should be helped in healing themselves.

gayRights/post_325:I'd like to know where you got that bogus information as well.  Have you interviewed ANY "ex-gay"?  Do you know anyone identifying themselves as gay or ex-gay?  I know both and the testimonies of those who are ex-gay are pretty encouraging that they can and have changed.  Here's some example (on these sites - can't seem to link the exact page):  http://www.pureheartministries.com  /  www.narth.com  Regarding the ones I know who identify themselves as "gay" are not what I would term the original definition of the word "happy".  Its like they picked that word so people would think they were happy, but they are bitter, unforgiving, and vindictive.  Here's a famous example:  http://www.iviewtube.com/videos/39264/perez-hilton-why-miss-california-did-not-win-miss-usa-pageant

gayRights/post_505:To say that "nobody knows what it means" in regard to "arsenokoitai" is completely incorrect and based on biased assumptive language - very poor debate form."arsenokoite" is a combination of the words "arseno" (male) and "koite" (bed, with a sexual connotation. We get our word "coitus" from this word).Paul, being a scholar of the Hebrew Scriptures, did with the Greek just as the Hebrew writers had done when writing what we know of as the Old Testament. They used the term "mishkab zakur" - "mishkab" meaning bed (with a sexual connotation), and "zakur", meaning male or males.When you say "Bible scholars think that Paul was either condemning sex with underage male prostitutes, or the rape of male prisoners of war," would you care to quote these sources? Being a Bible reacher myself, and having studies the texts in the original languages for over twenty years, I have yet to read any such scholarly work as you have mentioned. Please be sure that your sources are credible, yes?

gayRights/post_517:You Said "I Why do you assume that the expert's experience is illegitimate and just something like a choice to be monogamous?"I neither said nor implied that. Why put words in my mouth. The "experts" experience certainly is legitimate and I have said so in numerous other posts. I do believe that he is Gay but has chosen not to act on it. There's nothing he can do about being Gay just like I could not make myself become attracted to men. He can, and has chosen to live a non gay lifestyle.As the old clich goes: What we have here is a failure to communicate.Sorry but my original comment wasn't intended to put things in your mouth. I just wasnt discriminating between what you were saying and my own paraphrasing. Ill break it down and explain how I am interpreting and hopefully you will be able to then explain where you are coming from. In any case if we keep at it Im sure we can get there.Ill break up what I said into two bits. There is the bit about you assuming the experts experience is illegitimate. You make the claim that Alan Chambers is simply choosing not to act on his gay impulses and that there is nothing that he can do about being gay just like you could not make yourself attracted to men.Alan Chambers said: I know that thousands of men and women defy  and continue to defy  any possible genetic or biological links to homosexuality and changed their sexual orientation through the help of caring individuals, counseling and faith-based support groups.Certainly I am looking at it through the lens of my own experience but when he speaks of changing sexual orientation and speaks of his own experiences I take it to mean more than simply choosing not to act on gay impulses although that may have been the first step. By a change of sexual orientation I take it to mean that he has largely or completely lost his gay impulses in that he is either generally or completely no longer attracted to men. If I am correct then you consider his assertion and experience to be illegitimate when you assert that all that is involved is not acting on gay impulses and there is nothing that can be done about being gay and attracted to men. Does that make sense?I might as well add that the reason I chose you to respond to is that for someone in your situation to make the apparent pronouncement I feel disrespected to the extent that my experience overlaps with Alan's. I wouldn't feel that if a gay guy expressed that view.The second bit is the related. I am claiming that you are stating that his change of orientation is just like a decision to be monogamous. That is it is simply a case of not following urges. You used monogamy as an analogy and I inferred that in doing so you meant to communicate that nothing more is involved and that it is just an act of will power not a genuine change of orientation. Hopefully again this is sufficient explanation. Please feel free to let me know how I am misinterpreting.BTW your experiences are yours alone and do not refute the overwhelming evidence that the vast majority of Gay men cannot change their sexual orientation.I believe they give a better insight into the situation than your own experiences. Even if a majority either due to biological, environmental, or ingrained beliefs cant change but a minority can why couldnt Alan be in that minority?Barbaroni,Thanks for the response. That is not the way it appears to me. I've said what I've said but I can empathise with how you feel. I picture myself in your situation and believe that if I was you I'd feel frustrated with me. If so sorry.

gayRights/post_588:     The late Pope John Paul II was noted for quoting often the phrase "Christ...fully reveals man to himself."  from "Gaudium et Spes."  In the Christian tradition God and his commands are not "up there" far away in some Platonic other but right here, now in the present among us.  God came to Abram, his glory dwelt on Mt. Sinai with Moses, John the Baptist preached "the Kingdom of God is at hand," Jesus, "it is among us" and Jesus the Christ himself is the incarnation of God.  God's Word came present not "up there" but in time, in history, in the lives and languages of a real culture of and society amongst real individuals.       Universal moral law is only true in so much as it is indeed universal and based in the common good.  Not the good of an individual or a group but as it is the good for all.  In order for this to be so it must somehow exist ontologically in its own right, objectively and not in the will of man for the will of man is not only corrupt but subjective.  In this case the only moral law that can actually be true and universal is that law which is given from God.  Any other attempt for man to construct there own law, there own morals, there own understanding of right and wrong, good and evil is in fact from the evil one.  To do so would nuance the falsity that we are god, or anyway like God.  (see Genesis 3).  Rather God calls us into relationship with him not only because it is the good for us to do but because it is the purpose for which we are created.  God not only calls us to himself as an action of doing but as an action of being because it is who we are, after all God calls us into being.       How is it reconciled then, that we as humans need a morality that is actually attainable that isn't beyond our reach  that is as you said "for people."  God knows that his law is to high for people to achieve (see Romans 7).  This is precisely why he came not as other but as man and in doing so made the way for man to experience not only holiness and righteousness (as accorded by his law) but true peace with God and right relationship with him.  Jesus' humanity is evidence that it is possible and he is the way to our eternal Father, our divine Creator.  Jesus affords the way we must choose weather one will take that, accept God's offer of freedom and redemption or continue to neglect him and his holiness by living in sin.  Societies likewise, can compromise the truth and go on living "as every man sees fit" with the illusion of justice by "living and letting live." But dies this "live and let live" really provide true justice?  What about the injustice of psychological distress within a man, is this accounted for? Not because "live and let live" only accounts for interpersonal relationship not the inner justice of man.  Or how about acts of "so called freedom" that actually bring further bondage?  Are they ok if only consent is given?  Prostitution, fornication, drunkenness, consumerism?  All of these things go on under the guise of false justice, ie. live and let live, but in reality they continue to demean the integrity and intrinsic value of the human person.  The justice based in the reality that all men are created  equal is the justice of God for he has endowed men with such unalienable rights as life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Each human person, all men, all women, those who believe they are homosexual and those who do not, those born, those unborn, those dying they are all worth so much to God that he he gave his only begotten son to die that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting, full, life.  Christ speaks the freeing word, the word of liberty over all those who call on his name as they become who they truly are before sin and bondage and oppression came to foul our fallen race.  Jesus saves.  Jesus calls us to our original purpose, he is the fulfillment of our happiness.  True morality and justice accounts to the full truth of the human being and human experiance accroding to him who knows all things and all things about us, according to him who walked among us and made a way for real people, and who calls us into realtionship with him and gives us to the power to live holy, lives of right action and right being by putting His Spirit in those who believe in him.  This Spirit is the Lord the giver of life, who reigns with the Father and the Son, One God overall, for all, in love with all.  including you friend,Peace,Spencer

gayRights/post_619:"Only people who believe in the Christian "God" are moral, is what you're saying."Actually, I am not saying this.  Nothing I said should have given this conclusion however I apologize if it did.  Realativly speaking, all people are capable of morality.  However, we are only capable in as much as we respond to the Good given to us, not out of our own selves since man is by nature sinful (Romans 5).  Though I understand you may not agree with the Scriptures totally pherhaps we can share the common ground that no person is perfect, people are selfish and are not 100% good.  This is comparable to what the Scriptures talk about that people have a sin nature that we have inherited through Adam by which we have an innate tendency to bend toward sin, e.g. selfishness, unloving heart and behavior etc.  Since the Scriptures teach that God is reaching out to all people everywhere I actually believe that people may be able to act morally good in the true sense if they are responding out of grace given them and by the activity of the Holy Spirit in their soul whether they are Christian or not.  There is even the posiblity of man acting morally good out of an original goodness of man that has not been totaly corrupted by the marr of sin.  Even beside this sinful people may act morally good at a civil level, though not neccsarily in accordance with absolute good.  That is why I say realativly speaking there is moral good that people who are not believrs can do.  Even the good that Christians do, that nonbelievers supposdly cannot due, is the result of the goodness of God at work in them and not any more claimable by that person then any other.  If it wasn't for God they wouldn't be any different.  I hope that wasn't too confusing.  In your second argument you assume many things.  You assume that homosexuals are a class of people that have biological cause to their homosexuality.  In other words, they are "born with it."  Not only is this unverifiable it is not were good science is pointing.  Obviously it is not a choice.  As I have wresteled with my own homosexuality I will be the first to say "I did not choose this." But there is not way I was born this way.  You say: "Who the crap are you to know better than "God" how a person is supposed to be made?"Can't we I ask you the same question?  How do you know someone living a homosexual lifestyle is living according to God's design?  We know that it is not so because God has told us so through his Word. (1 Timothy 3:16, Leviticus 18:22)  You say: "If that person was made by "God" then it was "God" who created that sinful cocktail mix of chemicals that dictates to that person whom he or she will be sexually attracted to. That would make the act of "God" a sinful act... which, if you believe in "God"... you know can't happen."First off, God created sex and that "mix of chemicals" that all are a part of our sexuality are not sinful.  God created sex and he created it good.  The falleness of human nature lends what was originally good to all sorts of deviations.  The Catholic church (although I am not Roman Catholic) does not teach that a homosexual orientation is sinful but acting on it is, you are correct.  But, they do teach that it is an "intrinsic disorder" even an evil. Not that the person is responsible to that sin or evil but that the homosexual orientation is a manifestation of human falleness just like all sin is including deviations such as alcholisim and sexual addicition.  The homosexul is a victim to sin like all of us are.  Thanks be to God that he has provided a way out of this and brought life to us anew (Romans 5).  The Scriptures teach:"As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath. But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressionsit is by grace you have been saved."  (Ephesians 2:1-5, NIV) We were by natures objects of wrath but God still loved and loves us.  This is preciesly why he gave his son to us that if we believe in him we shall not perish but have everlasting, full life now and later.  The fact that all people are imperfect and have inclinations to sin is not a product of God's creative work but of Satan's twisting of the good creation through sin.  God did not sin in making any of us but all of us have falleness.  Homosexuality is just one of many manifestations of this falleness and like all mankind homosexuals are in need of a savior.

gayRights/post_624:"Rational moral truth is based on the observation that people are all basically the same, that they have the same fundamental physical, psychological, and spiritual needs (by "spiritual" I do NOT mean, religious or supernatural. I merely mean needs that are not physical)."This understanding of human sameness or shared anthropology is incomplete precisely because you leave out the actual spiritual element of man yet give the illusion that it is included.  The idea that all people are basically the same, i.e.. created equal (again something only guaranteed  by God), is a Biblical idea.  One could suppose that in a modern rationalistic society why would we put so much stock in a principle from a "dusty old book?"  Perhaps because this dusty old book is right.  You include the physical, biological or bodily part of man (Gk. Soma) and the psychological part (Gk.psyche), but by defining spiritual by something that it is not you actually fail to give an adequate definition which is to state which that thing is.  Equating spiritual needs to "merely...needs that are not physical" fails to distinguish between what is actually a spiritual need and what could also be a emotional need or a psychological need which can also not be considered physical in the biological sense.  The implication of this vaguely communicated idea of spiritual need actually leaves out the real essence of spiritual need.  This is necessary to fit the paradigm of "live and let live" because such a structure of apparent moral law fails to account for the totality of the human experience not just in the individual human experience but in the communal as well.  It is incapable of doing so because the motive is not the ultimate concern for the common good but an excuse of the individual to unconcern them self with the good of the other.  As the concept "live and let live" is shaped by the humanistic framework of individuals operating as laws unto themselves, it fails.  When, as was originally meant in the phrase "live and let live," it is to literally do unto others as you would have them do unto you there is a change for hope.  Here the common good and the good of the neighbor is established.  It is not about how little should be done (tolerate, mind your own business about the life of others) but what should be done (how can I love my neighbor in this circumstance, what does it mean to love my neighbor?).  This is the a central teaching of Jesus Christ and of Christianity.  The modern   evolution   of the idiom however, has scarce remembrances of this original meaning and fails precisely because, again, it does not take into account the breadth of human experience both individually and communally (and is unequipped to address the full experience because its own ethos makes such parts and judgments of others off limits) and has no concern for the common good (because likewise the good cannot be established because the ethos of the modern "live and let live" make such judgments impossible).  I should clarify by judgments I don't intend to imply being judgmental  but rather only the ability to judge whether the actions, motives and intentions of the other are morally right or wrong according to the Good.  Compare:"Live and let live, i.e. Do as you would be done by..."-1678, English Proverbs"Live and let live is a pretty good philosophy. If the guy in the next lane isn't buckled up, why not leave him alone?" (2001, Washington Times)Both quotes acquired from the The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs.[See also my other post, "Christ...fully reveals man to himself."]Secondly, you further beg the question, i.e. provide a circular argument, by stating that live and let live is good because watching people live and let live (without the ability to harm others) is good because you have observed it so.  You then conclude, therefore, that homosexuality is not morally wrong.  This is Non Sequitur; where the logic of your agrument does not follow from the premise to the conclusion offered.  Peace and Happy New Year,Spencer

gayRights/post_678:=========SODOM=========The Sodom Story - Genesis 19:1-29Homophobic Viewpoint: "Sodom was destroyed because of   homosexuality  ." Scriptural Viewpoint: Sodom was a lush beautiful region of land whose inhabitants had known the goodness of God. Despite their exposure to, experience with, and witness of the one true loving Creator, the people of Sodom had rejected a relationship with God, and turned to numerous types of idolatry. When God's messengers were sent to the city, the men of Sodom responded by threatening the ultimate act of violent abuse,   murder  , disrespect and humiliation. They were going to RAPE God's representatives. All other Old and New Testament references to Sodom involved the sins of idolatry, inhospitality, indifference toward the poor and the rejection of God's messengers. There are NO REFERENCES to same sex acts or HOMOSEXUALITY. The story of Sodom had nothing to do with homosexuality.====================CORINTHIANS ====================This passage virtually shows how many twist and change God's words to spread hate.I Corinthians 6:9-11Let us examine that very closely.Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate [malakoi], nor   homosexual   offenders [arsenokoites], nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God.First of all, before we address this line, let us consider one thing. Supposedly taken from a 2000+ year old book, understand that the word "homosexual" was not coined until 1869 by Austrian-born novelist Karl-Maria Kertbeny. So how it happens to be included in a true reading of the particular biblical passage should make you ponder how accurate the interpretation actually is. So man changing the words of the Bible to conveniently spread hate? I think so.Now onto the interpretation, i've included the original Greek words as well where it's relevant.Paul was attempting to educate the new Christians in Corinth as to what Godly living was all about. In verses 9-10, he listed ways of living that were not compatible with a Christ-centered life. In verse 11, Paul reminded them that they had been saved out of those destructive ways. There are two Greek words in I Corinthians 6:9, which sometimes are translated with a homosexual connotation. First word, "malakoi" or "malakos" - it literally means soft or mushy; it can mean spineless, wishy-washy or without backbone. "Malakoi" was used four other times in the New Testament and it always meant "soft." The context of I Corinthians seems to imply a moral softness or decadence, a failure to stand up for what is right and godly. It is significant that for several hundred years there was no sexual connotation assigned to this word. Second word, "arsenokoitai" or "arsenokoites" - it literally means, "males having sex." Early commentaries on I Corinthians related "arsenokoitai" to male temple prostitutes and to men having sex with boys. (Idolatrous prostitution and pedophilia are always wrong for those seeking to honor God.) Homosexual relationships were known in the Greco-Roman culture of Paul's day. The Greek word commonly used in reference to adult male same sex partners was "arrenokoites." Paul did not use this word. Instead, he created his own, "arsenokoitai." If Paul had intended to condemn all adult male same sex partners, he would have used the common word for it.

gayRights/post_697:It is dangerous to argue that we as humans know God's intent. To simply state "God's original intent is..." is simply an opinion, not a fact. These statements have been used throughout history, but are based more in traditions than in factual evidence. Several opinions about "God's intent" have shown to be false.At one time people believed that God did not create all races equal and that slavery is acceptable. This is very easy to be supported Biblically, for there is a consistent opinion throughout scripture that slaves must submit to their master, and the Bible states "slaves are property." Nowhere in the Bible is slavery condemned. If you believe owning another person as property is wrong, you will not be able to   support   that Biblically. It was believed that   women   were not created equal to men and women have a lower mental capacity than men; women must submit to men. People argued God separated the races for a reason and therefore races should not intermarry. There are Bible verses that, when taken literally, support all of these statements.The churched condemned Galileo as a heretic because he said the earth revolved around the sun. Their understanding was that God created the earth and put humans on it. Therefore, the earth must be the center of the universe. Many well respected religious such as John Calvin and Martin Luther quoted scripture against Galileo. They could not get past their understanding of God's Intent.We cannot know God's original intent and therefore cannot use this as an argument.

gayRights/post_702:The context is important, I am not denying that, but we must ask ourselves what is actually condemned.  The Leviticul condemnation is not of prostitution, although the Scripture also condemns that activity both in the context of idolatrous worship and street prostitution, but of any sexual actions between two people of the same sex.  It is an abomination because it flies in the face of God's intention for sexuality.  As previously stated this command is given in a list of commandments that condemn other sexual perversities, that distort the original intended in the sexual gift.

gayRights/post_730:In both of these passages, Paul uses the Greek term arsenokoite in reference to male homosexuality.  The conventional understanding has been that Paul is specifically addressing homosexuality within this passage.The pro-gay theological stance is that Paul is extremely concerned about prostitution within I Corinthians 6 and is mainly referring to male prostitutes.  This word is only used within I Corinthians and I Timothy but nowhere else in the literature of the period.(1)  John Boswell states that there were other words for homosexual in the Greek language so there was little need to use this term.(2)   Also the word arsenokoite is a term that Paul has created from the words arsenos (man) and koite (couch or bed) and is specific to him.  Therefore, Paul is condemning sexual immorality in general and not referring to committed homosexual relationships.  While it is true that the term arsenokoite appears to be of Pauls invention, the context in which it appears is not nullified because of Pauls originality.  In fact, Paul coined 179 words throughout the New Testament.  The words arsenos and koiten are taken directly from the Holiness Code of the Septuagint.(3)   Because arsen is Greek for man and koites means bed, the connotation of sexual activity is predominant.  The Septuagints translation of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 places the words arsenos and koite in close proximity to each other and is suggested by Martii Nissinen that Paul is creating a neologism based upon the Septuagint.(4)   These are the previously referred passages in which homosexual behavior is expressly forbidden.  This further complicates the position that another meaning other than homosexuality is implied.  In I Corinthians 5:1, Paul begins by addressing sexual matters with the general term porneia, sexual immorality.  This is applied to a case of heterosexual immorality in verse 1 regarding a mans stepmother.  In the following verses there are initial references to porneia referencing heterosexual immorality followed by arsenokoitai which references the homosexual contrast.(5)    In this context, one must consider the intent of arsenokoite in its perceived application to prostitution.  Arsenos signifying male is a clear emphasis on gender.   Koite meaning couch is listed only twice in the New Testament in a sexual connotation.  There is nothing within these words that would implicate a trade or bartering.  __________________________________1 Rev.

gayRights/post_774:Let's observe the truth.Mr. Rick Brentlinger wrote in response to point a):"a) Gods exclusive design of male and female relationships as stated in GenesisGod never says or implies in the Genesis historical account, that his anatomical design of males and females requires ONLY male-female partnerships or that male-male and female-female partnerships draw His wrath"->My objection:Perhaps you missed the fact that Leviticus 20:13(Lev 20:13)  If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.That word translated "lies with" is "shakab" in the original and all the word scholars interpret it as "lying down with in affection and sexually" See Strong's Hebrew and Greek concordance (H7901) and New American Exhaustive Concordance, also Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions. Here another point. The Old Testament is filled with laws governing the sexual relationships between men and women, give me one, just one, instance of God's laws favoring healthy sexual relationships between two men or two women. NONE!!!!! You will never find ONE! Why? Because God doesn't condone any of it. Lev. 20:13.Any other interpretation of God's word to the contrary of Homosexuality as sin is a direct assult on God's moral integrety.Finally, in conclusion, The laws of God are a teacher to expose sin as being truly sinful. Some sins are greater than others and so incurred an immediate death sentence like rape, beastiality, homosexuality, incest, etc. However, there are others that, yet still sinful, don't incur an immediate death sentence like this one;(Deu 22:5)  "A woman shall not wear man's clothing, nor shall a man put on a woman's clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD your God."This is were I disagree with J. Buchanan and others who say that no sin is worst than another. That's poor theology. What's true is that all but one sin is forgivable at the cross. Only blaspheme against the Holy Spirit is unforgiveable.Jesus Christ paid for that punishment, but He didn't nullify it's weight of sinfulness. We escape God's wrath by first repenting, and secondly, accepting His atonement, and lastly, living rightly in God's eye's alone, henceforth.Read your bible and stop listening to deceitful men. Jesus promises that all those who sincerely seek the real truth, and who do so with God alone as their source of truth, shall find it. Men(including me) are short sighted and don't hold all truth, we need to seek it from God alone and He will only do it through Jesus Christ (The Word made flesh).Seek verses like, John 8:34, Matt. 5:17-20, Gal. 3:22-24, John 8:34, Rom. 6:6, Luke 9:56

gayRights/post_775:To get at the original intent of why the Bible appears to condemn homosexuality, we must take a dive into the Middle Ages.According to William N. Eskridge, Jr. (writing under the Virginia Law Review), "The early church fathers  most notably Clement, Jerome, Origen, and Augustine  developed a philosophy of sexual abstinency that problematized any sexual activity done for pleasure itself.  But other, non-Christian traditions in Roman society  Stoicism, Neo-Platonism, Manicheanism  similarly urged that 'intercourse was supposed to take place only so as to produce children.  The couple must not make love for the sake of pleasure alone.'"The last sentence is crucial, here.  The couple must not make love for the sake of pleasure alone.  Why?  Because it is selfish and serves no productive purpose for society.  The ideas behind homosexual acts being a sin are the same as heterosexual acts with contraceptives being a sin, or the same as masturbation being a sin.  Pure, selfish pleasure is bad because it is unproductive and turns the focus from helping society to helping one's self.When the Bible condemns homosexuality, it condemns selfishness.  Homosexual love isn't selfish.  Homosexual love is no different from heterosexual love.  Homosexual love represents devotion, affection, trust, respect, all of the same ideals that heterosexual love represents.  True homosexual love is selfless.Don't hate homosexuality.  Hate selfish acts.

Your last post reads like you have no idea of the preceding discussion.Most of the material I previously cited can be found on this page, with the many Links provided there.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/My-Coming-Out.html   Suffice it to say that in previous posts, I have more than adequately covered each of the scriptures you quoted.For you too quote them again, as if they can only be negative statements about committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships is less than thoughtful.None of the verses you cited even mention homosexuality in Hebrew and Greek. You are reading your twenty first century notions into texts that are 2000 - 3400 years old.In some English versions, (I Corinthians 6:9 for example), translators have inserted a false translation, using the word, homosexual, when that word was never in the original.   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Define-Arsenokoites.html   I encourage you to do additional prayerful study.Your brother in Christ,Rick Brentlinger   http://www.gaychristian101.com/Jesus-On-Hell.html

gayRights/post_809:The Bible, in it's original language and context, doesn't even address homosexuality as we know it today...much less condemn it.The bottom line here is that most Christians still use all the old arguments about the Bible condemning homosexuality when it has been proven, time and again, that isn't the case.  I live a vibrant Christian life and have a wonderful relationship with my Lord Jesus Christ.  I also live a wonderful life with my female partner of 15 years, who is also a committed Christian.  It is possible to please the Lord and still be homosexual.  I'm nowhere near perfect, but I know from speaking with the Lord and hearing His voice that He is pleased with me.

gayRights/post_810:    "...it has been proven, time and again, that isn't the case."I don't know of a single time it's been "proven" that the Bible does not condemn homosexual behavior, let alone "time and time again." Only if you consider it proof for people to promote different ideas based on their own personal preferences.   "The Bible, in it's original language and context, doesn't even address homosexuality as we know it today..."This is exactly what I was talking about when I said, "He was never able to get past [the Biblical authors'] homophobia throughout thousands of years--until this enlightened generation came along and discovered what God really said." The idea that we have a somehow higher knowledge of homosexuality--a grasp of what it means to be "gay" that hasn't existed in all of human history, is arrogant and self-deceiving.

gayRights/post_816:ok.  so let me get this straight (no pun intended).  everyone who copied the bible from its original manuscripts just happened to leave out the 'pro-homosexual' verses?  hmm.  it's a conspiracy i see.  just like who really killed JFK.i'm sorry buckeye ... but are you serious?  that's how you answer my questions, by telling me that some bigoted people back in the day took the pro-gay verses out of the bible because they hated homosexuals?  well, why hasn't anyone ever gone back to the original documents - cause some are still around - and put back in the verses that were taken out?  i mean that would seem like a logical thing to do.you make a point that there are many 'men of GOD' who are married and yet come out later to be gay.  but honestly, i question them on that - and that's probably a whole other debate.  still, i highly would debate david being gay.  question: if david was gay, how do you deal with his lust and sexual encounter with bathsheba?  i don't know many self-proclaimed gay guys that go after women as well - do you?according to my bible - which is a common one among all Christians - this is what it says about johnathan's love for david:  johnathan loved david as he loved himself (1 samuel 20:17).  but isn't that the same command Jesus gave to all of us in new testament (mark 12:31)?next, i would like to also state that if you were to look at my post, no where do i ever state that homosexuality "is more of a sin than" anything else.  no where.  so please don't put words into my mouth - post.  i know full well that homosexuality is not the greatest sin.  last time i checked all sin is sin - regardless of who does it and what occurs.i agree with you that GOD loves everyone.  so true.  but don't forget that GOD is also a just and righteous GOD, and therefore HE also hates sin.  i'm a sinner.  you're a sinner.  we're all sinners (romans 3:23).  GOD doesn't hate me (the sinner) but HE does hate my sin.  this is truth - its all throughout scripture.when i speak, i am not judging you (or homosexuals) in the way that you are referring to (judge not lest ye be judged).  i do suggest though that you know the scripture before you use it against someone.  what Jesus is talking about is judging people from a hypocritical spirit/mindset - basically being self-righteous.  here's an example:  if i condemned you for sinning and said that you needed to be perfect like me, that would be judging like we're not suppose to.  because i'm not perfect.  but if i called you out on a sin, acknowledging that i too need accountability in my life for sins, than i am not judging.in fact if you are a christian, i have a right to call you out on doing something wrong just like you have a right to call me out (1 corinthians 5:12, proverbs 27:17).if you are not a christian - which i am not saying you are either way, cause i don't know - but if you're not, and you are offended by what i have written, i am sorry for offending you.  its not my intent to argue (nor am i arguing) - though i also will not back down from defending the truth.i have spent many years within this issue.  i feel confident about where i stand and where to draw the line between fact and fiction.  and by the way, i would appreciate you answering my questions, if you wouldn't mind.  thanks.

gayRights/post_832:For me, the most consistent, honest understanding of all the clobber passages is that the Bible is addressing shrine prostitution, not committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships.That being so, there are NO Biblical passages which condemn committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships.Only by taking the clobber passages out of their cultural, doctrinal, historical, linguistic and religious context can they be made to condemn two gay men who love each other or two lesbian women who love each other and want to spend their lives together.Talking to anti-gay Christians can be frustrating because they ping pong back and forth between equally inconsistent arguments.They will admit that, in context, none of the clobber passages is NOT talking about committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships.Then they ping pong back to their Complementarian argument, that since God originally created Adam and Eve, that "proves" God could never affirm Adam and Steve.  http://www.gaychristian101.com/adam-and-eve.html  When it is pointed out that Adam and Eve (one man with one woman for life) did NOT indicate God's prohibition of polygamy (notice Genesis 4:19 where the first polygamous marriage occurs and Deuteronomy 21:15 where God makes provision for inheritance in polygamous marriage situations) anti-gay Christians then ping pong back to the clobber passages and opine that it is "clear" that God is talking about homosexuality, even though they previously admitted that the context is shrine prostitution, NOT a committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnership.Ah, the joys of debating the Bible with the brethren...Rick Brentlinger  http://www.gaychristian101.com/Mission.html

gayRights/post_837:I truly don't understand why the concept of "sin" is raised at all. Clearly homosexuals are identical to heterosexuals in everything except sexual preference. Condemning someone for that seems entirely unchristian to me. The bible itself has been re-written, translated, intentionally altered dozens of times over the 1800 or so years. There were originally many more books, but only four were chosen, for most likely political reasons.There are passages in the bible that claim it is okay to allow fathers to KILL their children for disobeying. Citing chapters in the bible to prove a point is ignorant, pointless, stupid, and socially damaging, when many passages contain truly disgusting acts made by christians.

gayRights/post_848:Before we can determine what scripture means for us today, we must understand what it meant for the people to whom it was originally given back then. In plainer words, what scripture means today is limited by what it meant back then.Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN.Whatever meaning we assign to Paul's words has to have been a probable understanding in the first century.There are three areas which help us understand what Paul meant back then.1. The historical context. First century Rome was an idolatrous culture with hundreds of temples to pagan gods and goddesses. One fertility goddess in particular was Cybele, known as the Protectress of Rome.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-1.html    2. The religious context. The most prominent goddess figure in first century Rome was Cybele, the Phrygian fertility goddess. Five worship sites honored her in Rome at the time Paul wrote Romans.Roman coins bearing Cybele's likeness were inscribed with the words, Mater Deum, Mother of the gods.Cybele was worshiped by castrated Galli priests who offered themselves sexually to male worshipers.This is what Paul describes in Romans 1, citing the Old Testament experience of Jews who had rebelled against God and practiced fertility goddess worship.3. The way Christians back then understood Paul's words in Romans 1.Aristides, preaching before the Roman Emperor Hadrian, AD 126, linked Paul's words in Romans 1 to shrine prostitution.Justin Martyr, preaching around AD 150, linked Paul's words in Romans 1 to shrine prostitution.    http://www.gaychristian101.com/Romans-And-Shrine-Prostitution.html    To read Romans 1 today and say scripture is condemning a committed, faithful, non-cultic lesbian or gay partnership is to give the text a new meaning which was unknown to the original readers.And if it was unknown to the original readers, then that interpretation cannot be true because:Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN.

gayRights/post_851:You said Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN.  This is a true statement.  However, Scripture can have a different application then it did back then.  You seem to be very concerned with the cultural context of cult prostitution in ancient Rome.  And you seem to define "idolatry" in a very narrow sense.  But Paul does not do this.  Go on to Romans 1:28 when he begins to describe all manner of idolatry (which is simply worshipping anything besides creator God--today this could include worship of another person, worship of self, worship of money, worship of television, etc.):  "And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.  They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice.  They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness.  They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.  Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them" (ESV).So, is Paul still only talking about cult prostitutes here?  He seems to be talking about everyone.  I am thinking about the times I have envied, or gossiped, or was disobedient to my parents.  The question I am asking is:  why would Paul have switched so rapidly from talking about a specific group of people to talking about everyone?First and foremost, we must understand what Paul was trying to say with his words.  What was the author intended meaning.  This is primary.  It is strongly related to how the original audience would have understood Paul's letter, but they are not the same thing.  You seem to have given precedence to the cultural context of the passage over and above the context of the passage in the letter itself.  Both are equally important.  I would argue that placing a passage within the context of its surrounding passages, within the context of the letter itself, and within the context of the Bible as a whole is first and foremost in biblical interpretation.  Cultural context is our aide along the way, but if our findings do not fit the context of the surrounding passages, then we need to go back to the drawing board and reassess what Paul was trying to say.What do you think?

gayRights/post_864:I believe that was ruined long ago.    Furthermore, marriage sucks.  I'm not kidding.  Unless you think it acceptable and sanctimonious to sell you daughter?  Or unless you believe that women are merely property of men?  That's the original intent of marriage and for thousands of years, that's how it went.  Calling a hideous tradition a sanctimonious act is like calling slavery sanctimonious.    Simply because this has changed to marriage being an actual choice between two consenting adults who love each other doesn't change the history of the act, does it?  Nor  was the "sanctity" of marriage any less sanctimonious when it was illegal for inter-racial couples to tie the knot.And just how has the sanctity of marriage been preserved and protected from heterosexual couples? Britney Spears? Drew Barrymore? A 17 hour marriage? Drive-thru chapels?  Sanctimonious enough for you?What is UNACCEPTABLE is for one brainwashed group of people to say that homosexuality is not okay.  What is UNACCEPTABLE is for one brainwashed group of people to use democracy to discriminate against another group simply because it "suits your own desires or your own agenda."You do not have to like homosexuality anymore than I like the fact that some people will continue to  wear crosses around their necks and carry guns in their hands and march off into war because it's their duty for country.  As if the laws they say they live their by are superseded by their love country.  (Which, you don't have to say anything about that, I'm using it as an example of what I have to accept.)    What you cannot and should not do is to support laws that intentionally leave out a group of people simply because they are in the minority.  Unless, of course, you thought it was perfectly acceptable for laws to be made that discriminated against black people simply because black people were in the minority.Stop lying to yourself.

gayRights/post_904:You're making the assumption that homosexuality is not natural - that only sex between man and woman is natural and therefore what binds them together.  Homosexuality is quite natural. It exists in nature between animals and also in humans. You're also making the assumption that marriage has typically been between one man and one woman.  As if the entire world has always shared this decidedly Christian view.  Furthermore, in most societies - including those ancestral societies you speak of in which the child was better off with the biological mother and father - the raising of the child has typically been a group effort. It's only been in our society, within the past 200 years that this has changed.  What benefits children is having as many people as possible in their lives who love and support them.  It makes little difference if these people are biologically related, or married.  Gay marriage isn't about raising children, it's the right that exists to bind yourself to a person for rest of your life if you so choose.  Placing another factor in the mix doesn't say anything about the original argument - that gay marriage is wrong.And further to that - marriage is a religious act.  Government should makes no laws establishing rules of any religious ceremony (barring sacrifices of humans or anything that infringes upon the rights of another).

gayRights/post_965:No one is redefining the definition of marriage.  Marriage means quite literally the joining of entities - be it buisnesses, ideas, people, elements...etc.  But for the sake of things changing... here are some words that have changed: Commit:  to come together - but now it also means a number of other things.Luxury: originally meant lasciviousness or lustCookie: both means   food   and now has tech meaning as wellMouse: animal and techScroll: ancient piece of paper... and how one moves down the screenUndertaker: old meaning entrepreneur, now entrepreneur means small business ownerInspire: to breath life into - now also means to elicit, to move to action etc.Nice: use to mean 'not to know', but now it means something well... nice. :)  good.Bundle of sticks - in the old english - now is a derogatory wordGay: meant happy or merry - so quite litterally when when everyone was happy - it meant everyone was gay. Obviously the meaning has changed.  But in the case of marriage - it is not changing, at least not in the true sense of change as noted above. It still means to come together, to bind, to join, to create a union... etc.  All citizens should have the right to choose their life partner, marry them, and enjoy the benefits of doing so.

gayRights/post_986:1.) If a few scholars/linguists agree that "homosexuals" is a fair translation of the original text, then you are absolutely right. I don't have enough background in Greek nor in the Bible itself to figure it out. If the translation is accurate [which neither you or I can really know...] then you're absolutely right and this passage does speak against   homosexuality  .2.) What does it matter how I believe the universe was created? I only said that if God created the universe [which He might have] we cannot use our existence as proof of it. I never discredited Creationism. Even if I had, that does not necessarily mean I believe in "Evolution." You're quick to assume my beliefs and even quicker to disprove them. Also, the Big Bang and Evolution are two entirely different theories and should be addressed as such.3.) It is not crucial to accept God as an author to understand an argument put forth. That's like saying non-believers are incapable of understanding your ways. An argument should be evaluted for its reasoning, not who said it. There are also more than a few contradictions in the Bible. You'd have a much stronger argument by saying that there aren't many. And I'm sure some groups have 40+ members in complete agreement with each other sometimes. It's not impossible.

god/post_10:There are a lot of arguments about the existence of GOD. Some try to prove scientifically and logically. What we need to know is that GOD is so much much bigger (beyond our imagination) than what we can think of. We cannot limit GOD with our (limited and simple) mind. GOD creates everything, there is no way that the created being can think about the CREATOR. In a simple analogy we can put it this way, a computer programme cannot explain about the programmer unless the programmer put it in the programme he or she wrote. The same way is with our GOD, unless GOD reveals to us (humankind), there is no way we know or understand about GOD. The other thing that we need to know, we live in a different dimension from GOD. For this reason we cannot enter the other dimensions. Talking about poverty, sickness and all the problems in this world we cannot avoid not to talk about sins. To explain about this we need to refer to the original sin (as what is written in the Bible in the book of Genesis). As we know, GOD so loves the world that HE has given HIS only begotten Son to die for humankind. From here we can see that GOD wants every single human being to be saved from "the dead" (eternal separation from GOD). When GOD walked on this earth in form of humankind like us, HE also experienced all the sufferings known to this world. So, HE perfectly knows about this. Another thing we need to know is that life is more than "walking" on this planet (which is only a very small fraction of the "real" life - in the life after). After all if we really want to know about GOD, we simply need to ask GOD to reveal HIMSELF to us so that we can understand what is beyond our (limited and simple) mind.By the way, if you are interested in knowing about this futher, based on my experience, there is an excellent book that explain clearly. The name of the book is "The Progress of Redemption: The Story of Salvation from Creation to the New Jerusalem" by Willem Vangemeren (you can look at the internet).Finally, what I can say, if we really ask and humble ourselves, GOD will definitely reveal HIMSELF to us in HIS own way.

What I don't understand is how God created the human race and then destroyed the entire human race. Then allowed it to flourish again, and now all of us who don't accept Jesus into our hearts will go to hell. Wait a minute isn't he all knowing, didn't he know what was going to happen when he originally created me. He loves me so much he sent his son to die on the cross for  me so my sins could be forgiven but... he made me this way and he knew it was going to turn out this way before I was born. If I don't believe in him he knows my heart and he'll judge me accordingly.

god/post_18:Ahh The Problem of PainHowever keep in mind, "Science doesn't provide us with truth. The practice of scientific investigation involves tools that help us explain how the physical world might work. The explanation doesn't have to be true to be useful, just consistent with most of the evidence." (Spencer).Yet   religion   does not provide us with the truth eitherThe evidence when studied just facts points towards a designer.Actually no, there has been no demonstrated evidence that even suggests a designer.Chance is ruled out through mathematical probability.Blind chance, yes but Evolution is not about blind chance.  Evolution is the process by which life forms   change   from generation, with those changes that benefit reproduction having a greater chance of being passed down to successive generations.For more on this read Robert Collins, Jay W. Richards, or Guillermo Gonzalez. For scientific evidence in molecular biology read Michael Behe, and Johnathan Wells. I would encourage reading opposing view from   evolution   scientist such a Ruse. It is good to know why you choose you evidences. To which Id   add   Richard Dawkins, Ken Miller, Sean Carroll, and Stephen Gould.  The argument is evolution believes that nothing came from nothing to create something over billions of years.That is not quite accurate everything came from the original singularity, including space-time.The bang has a cause.Yes, and that is currently an area of much Scientific investigation.The idea that something comes into existence un-caused is absurd.Very true so what caused the designer?

god/post_252: Good is the   health  , well-being and longevity of our entire species and planet. You can believe in a   god   and be for the good of all humanity or you can not believe in god and be for the good of all humanity. On the other hand saddling people with original sin, the fall of man and a final judgment day is definitely not good for the psychic of humankind. If we become extinct through our own suicidal self-destructive tendencies taught to us by people who claim to believe in god, will it be god's fault? Therefore the Abrahamic god and all gods are irrelevant compared to love.

god/post_264:Zebrakin appears to be a believer and that no amount of reasoned argument will change his mind.However, in the event that I'm wrong and that I can change his mind, I point out that it is a mistake to consider being convinced of something is the same as believing something.  The concept conviction is an intellectual conclusion based usually on a lengthy examination of the facts of reality. The concept belief is an abandonment of the intellect and an acceptance of what others have asserted without evidence or proof. Belief is ultimately based on wishes, and requires self-abnegation. Conviction is based on logic and requires self-assertion. Zebrakin states that I consider belief "pathetic foolishness."  Okay, but not accurate. In this day and age, I consider religious belief to be the most lethal form of brute force that men have invented. It stunts one's consciousness and tears it in two, attributing one's best to the non-existent and requiring one regard oneself as sacrificial fodder for the benefit of others. It is a boon to man's rational faculty that he can marvel at the beauty of the universe. But that is not "in born." Such an estimate arises from a fundamental regard of nature as benevolent and of man as heroic. That this is true is shown by the fact that many men do not regard the universe with wonder, nor look upon man as basically good. Instead they regard nature as a threat and man as basically evil. The better philosophers, such as Aristotle and Ayn Rand, have answered the questions you raise. ("to discover where [men] have come from, where they go to, and why they are here.") Many scientists, such as archeologists and physicists, have helped by adding factual details.  I sense in your closing statement a melancholy I should like to tell you is not necessary to feel. You wrote: "Perhaps we feel we have to find answers to these questions because somewhere we know that there's more to this life." A proper moral code, found in Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism, shows that one need not wish that life is somehow better beyond the grave where men will find true happiness. One can find true happiness here on earth while we live. But to do so requires courage to face the reality that you have far greater intellectual strength than your religion tells you, far greater wealth of spirit that your beliefs suggest you possess, and that you are far superior in value to those you are taught to sacrifice yourself for. You can find happiness now by rejecting the moral code of your religion and discovering the rational moral code of Objectivism, which briefly put says your life belongs to you and the good is to live it rationally. May I suggest you read Ayn Rand's novels?---Especially Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead. In addition to being wonderfully original stories, they will help you to re-discover what your religion may have caused you to loose.

god/post_58:"But that's not what the Bible says..."You're right. The bible says to kill gays and to kill unbelievers. It preaches hatred and discrimination in the worst way. It pretends that it preaches a holy, merciful message. But it legitimizes hatred, intolerance and murder.The ironic part is your precious Bible isn't even original. Your silly creation stories (yes, your bible has more than one of them) can be found in Sumerian texts that predate the old testament by centuries, even millenia. Which makes sense - the Hebrew tribes would have been decendent from Sumerian tribes. In fact, most of Genesis (the Ark and the flood? Pah-leeze) can be very easily traced to earlier, non-jewish stories.But I'm sure it's just god spreading seeds of dissent to test the resolve of believers. Keep denying logic, fact and the truth of your very existence. I'm sure your god is pleased.

god/post_590:It's not God who orders that though is it?Perhaps I am not getting your point, because your original argument seems to me to rest entirely on how belief in a "perfect, wise" creator being affects human behavior. And my point is, not always in good ways. Sometimes in good ways (as I have posted on at greater length), and sometimes in very horrible ways. The question wasn't about the existence of a god, but about belief in a god, and as an extention how such beliefs affect human actions.

god/post_593:You put to[o] much emphasis on man.This whole discussion is about how belief in a god or gods affects humankind -- not about your personal belief system. Emphasis on man's reactions and how a belief in a god affects said reactions is, in fact, the entire topic of the debate here.one of the ten commandments [is] thou[ ] shall not kill.One of the other 10 commandments - in fact the 1st -- is that "thou shalt have no other gods" business that is the source of so many holy wars.As a point of interest, the original text of the Sixth Commandment read "thou shalt not kill other Israelites." You could kill all the Canaanites, Babylonians, Akkadians et. al. that you liked.I have never known of any Christian . . . to ask for anybody to be put to deathYou've never known of Christians asking for someone to be put to death? Then you've not read history. Start with imperial Rome and its campaigns throughout Europe and Asia, and also pay particular attention to the Reconquista, all nine of the Crusades into western Asia, the Saxon Wars and spread of the Holy Roman Empire, the Baltic Crusades, the Inquisition, the Reformation, the European witchcraze, the conquest of the Americas, the McCarthy era, and the bombing of abortion clinics by wingnutty members of "Christian Century." I'd be mighty surprised if you could find a single ten-year block anywhere in the last 1500 years during which Christians were not asking for some other group of people to be put to death.

god/post_595:1) The Christians persecuted the pagan Romans with far, far more fervor than the pagan Romans had when "persecuting" Christians. Persecution of Christians prior to the conversion of Rome was occasional and local; the laws were directed primarily at clergymembers and at "church property." Extermination of non-Christians after the conversion of Rome, on the other hand, was a wholesale pogrom that lasted until Rome itself was no more.2) The original Sixth Commandment used a word for "murder" that only applied to the unjustified killing of Israelites. By definition, one could not "murder" a non-Israelite. So the commandment is more accurately translated as "don't kill your own." Had it been a blanket prohibition on killing, the Israelites would have been in violation of it quite routinely, as they attacked plenty of neighboring non-Jews.3) If "true Christians" never asked for anybody to be put to death, then by your own admission the entirety of your religion has been a big steaming pile o' horsehockey throughout its whole history, because Christians have been doing that since Christianity first appeared, and they still are.4) Not associating Catholics with Christians is looney-tunes. Catholics are the original, biggest, and most powerful Christian denomination. And the fact that "one of the main reasons why pilgrims left England was because of their freedom of religion to not be persecuted by Catholics" totally supports my point. Not only have the Christians been killing the non-Christians since time out of mind, but when they run out of non-Christians to kill they turn on each other. The Protestants and Catholics in England were equally brutal towards one another. Then the Protestants came to the Americas and massacred the native folks here. 5) You've reduced your position to "Christian equals me, and anybody who thinks exactly like me." Most self-defined "Christians" would not agree. You are not the authority on who is and isn't a "Christian." Hell, in my opinion, NONE of you are real "Christians" since you all blatantly ignore the teachings of Christ, who advocated giving up all worldly possessions and living an aesthetic lifestyle devoted to god. But leave that as it may, objectively the "Christians" are the people who define themselves as "Christians," and they've killed loads and loads of folks. So nope, still not buying your BS ("belief system") here.

god/post_596:And FYI, the original text of the Sixth Commandment read "thou shalt not kill other Israelites." You could kill all the Canaanites, Babylonians, Akkadians et. al. that you liked.That is pure Grade AAA bull crap. For there was a period of the Israelite history wherein they were Babylonians. And no, the original text of the sixth commandment was originally translated into English as : thou shalt do no murder. The commandment did not imply exceptions for the commandment. If you were to read the next chapter of Exodus that follows the Covenant with Israel, you will find that murderers are to be killed, including Israelites. What say you?

god/post_619:Well, I've been debating theists quite aggressively for a few days now on this site, and frankly I'm a little worn out from it. You need to try to understand, that you are looking at the world from a completely different perspective than I am. I know, because I was very religious until my early twenties, it's 2 completely separate mindsets, and it's almost like two different languages one trying to communicate with the other, but I will go through your objections from my point of view the best I can.1. I believe one can account for their perspective on good and evil in humans. We are a pack animal, always have been. Even dog's, with 0 knowledge of any religion, know to protect and "be kind" to others in their pack, including their owner whom they see as the pack leader. In the same way, we as humans I believe naturally act in a manner which serves the "pack" even often at expense to ourselves. Those who remain within this norm of pack behaviour we call "good" those without we call "evil".Being brighter and more complex than dogs or any other pack animal, of course this instinct within ourselves becomes complex. But natural and observable none the less with or without any type of creator.2. True, if there was a creator, it would make sense to find our purpose of creation, even if our purpose for being created was strictly for his amusement. But I don't believe in intelligent design either, so not sure how that pertains to my arguement.3. Again, justice is established using our general and natural idea of empathy. And as we see this is not a constant, but shifts with time as we evolve. Empathy is a very natural instinct most humans are born with, which has developed because it does serve for the greater good of humans, even in the circumstance that it should not be in one instance or another the greater good for oneself.This is from us (again) being a pack animal. I think you'll find that if you take away our big brains, we really are a pathetic and week creature compared to most mamals.Minus our big brain, without the abilty to work together as a whole, and this means establishing rules and a sense of justice, we would be quite extinct right now, having all been eaten by lions and tiger and bears oh my.4. I would argue no one "grounds it", even the religious. What difference does it make what one's morals are grounded in if they have them none the less? The only relevent point is that a god is unnecessary for one to have a reason to live or a moral compass to live by. I never said the religious don't feel their morals are grounded, I simply offer myself as proof that the idea many of the religious have, that life without a god is somehow empty, is quite incorrect.5. mass murder read it, tons of examples. Just as many examples of the religious killing as of the non-religious killing. There is no proof to back up the idea that a person who doesn't believe in a god is more or less likely to kill, than one who believes in a god, and somehow twists it so that their god encourages the act of killing. Your arguement holds no water.6. I don't see what you're refering to, if you are numbering this according to my highlighted points, there is no evidence either way, and that's my point. There's a lack of evidence here.7. But this is the point. Your original arguement puts forth that, the religious are more moral because they have specifically religion to guide them. My point is again, while religion guides the vast majority of the human population (82% apx) those not guided by a religion are just as likely to be "good" or "evil" which would appear to make the belief in a god unnecessary in order to be "moral"8. lol, this was hard to read. I'm not impressed by pretty words when discussing theology. I'm not swayed by mindless examples. My belief is one caught in a rip-tide is just as likely to drown whether they believe in god or not. You seem to be under the impression that there is something in life to be saved from. I do not see it this way. This is what I'm talking about when I say that it's like two people trying to communicate in two different languages. You do not seem to understand that I do not believe there is anything to be saved from in the general sense, and in the literal sense, I've never seen or heard of god saving anyone whose life was in mortal danger. Some live, some die, belief in god does not change these odds at all. The religious listen to example after example of people saying "I was saved" it's indoctrinated into the fiber of your being. From the outside, it looks like silly people looking for an easy way out. No one is saved, because there is nothing to be saved from. We live, we die, we make what we make out of it in the time in between. God plays no role. Some choose to believe in a god, but those who do not are just as happy, and quite often more so, than those who do. And in the end, whether someone believes in a god or not, they die and it's lights out. I don't think a religious person will "live forever" any more than I believe I will "live forever". What one believes is irrelevant ultimately outside of what they do with it here on earth while alive.Now, the religious can hardly (if at all) wrap their heads around the concept of simply being dead. It's like they have to believe there is an after-life, and by default, have to believe that everyone else must on some level at least want to believe there is an afterlife.I assure you, I do not on any level believe in an afterlife. I do not want to on any level trick myself into believing in an afterlife. I believe it is self-destructive to fool oneself in such a way.9. You have some typos that make this hard to understand. I think what your saying is that my account of how religion started is off,in which case the point flew clear over you, which it always does when I get into these discussions.Again, it's nearly impossible to explain to one such as yourself.But I'm not trying to explain exactly how religion began.I was simply giving an alternative example in order to point out my opinion thatreligion is quite unnecessary. That is what th point was.There is no point in me trying to guess how it all started (though I imagine it was from an inherent need within born of self-realization to not cease to exist at some point, which is not even the theory I put forth, but there you go)As I was saying, there is no point for me trying to guess though how it all started, and I don't care how or why it all started.My only point is that it is unnecessary.

god/post_682:CASE STUDY: Why it's impossible to have a meaningful debate about god with the indoctrinated.Sentence 1: "There are millions of people out there who are uneducated and I would say they are more likely to go to heaven than I am."Sentence 2: "This is purely an argument about God, regardless of what religion is brought in. Not religion, not religious texts, scriptures, rules etc.""This class is classic behaviour of those within a cult. They can in one sentence make a broad statement reflecting specifically their religious beliefs as stated as fact with absolutely no supporting evidence at all,then in the next sentence accuse the one being debated of doing what the cult member just did, whether the original argument in any way reflected the response.It is odd behaviour to any outside of that person's mind. But to that person, it is nearly impossible to see the hypocrisy, and frankly the silliness of the statement.

god/post_707:1. These prophets MAY just be intelligent people as you said. But they have ALL claimed to be related to God in some way. If they ARE followers of God, then great. If they're NOT, then why have they 'used' God? THAT was my original argument.. the reasons for having God. (I've been completely sidetracked).2. The reason I do not want to bring in religion is for the reasons you've stated. There are several different religions all doing different things and as soon as we start discussing God's word as interpretted by these religions, we'll be arguing about religions and not God.The mother does not explain to the child because the child will not understand, it will just continue to cry and beg. In the same way we do not understand God's word, but in both circumstances the child and us people will benefit if we follow God's/mother.we know that we shouldnt kill because it is common senseSomeone rapes a child.. should he be killed?You go to war, should you kill?You loose your temper, should you kill?Someone is trying to kill you, should you kill?You've had enough of life, should you kill yourself?You're in a vegetative state, should you be killed?God will tell us the right answer no matter what. However people have different opinions on those questions and both will argue their side. Who's right and who's wrong. Nobody on earth truly knows the impact of the decision they've made. This goes to your education point too. You're telling me all the finest, most educated people on the planet make the choices? in terms of ethics, religion etc?

god/post_77:  Is their a Creator or not?  Sometimes I feel we debating vast topics such as this, the first creation and original divine purpose is much like two ants walking a beach arguing how many grains of sand there are and how they got there.  They thought the earth was round once you know.  All we know by way of science is by experimental.  If there was a God, you'd think there'd be a better way.  There is.  A witness far better than sight.  If I may, I'd like to step aside the intellectual bottleneck and offer this simple idea:  You can judge a lifestyle by its effects like you can judge a tree by its good or bad fruit.  To believe there is no God is to believe in no afterlife because when brain functions end, thats it.  End of story.  How utterly pointless would it all be then.  Whats the point?  There would be none.  On the contrary however, if there is God, lets say our Heavenly Father, then there is no end with ceasing of simple brain function.  There is much more beyond the veil of our understanding, and we can peak through and know if we are willing to receive it and and act upon it.    Another idea is this:  Here I am in this body, there you are in yours.  That is no accident.  There are trillions of living things on this earth.  Plants, Bacteria, Animals, etc.  But, here you are as a human being with the capacity to think, reason and act; free will.  The apes didn't have that.  I've never heard of an ape committing suicide yet Humans do it all the time sadly.  I testify that God lives.  He is active in our lives and he does manifest himself to us.  He has to me and I'm not crazy.  There, you have my witness; dont believe just because you haven't had the same, because at some time we all will have that experience and all will know the truth.  I dont understand all things but this I know.  Heres the words of an ancient prophet, see if this is a good answer for those requesting a sign: "43 And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a asign, that I may be convinced that there is a God, yea, show unto me that he hath power, and then will I be convinced of the truth of thy words.  "44 But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of aall these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the bearth, and call things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its dmotion, yea, and also all the eplanets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator."You'll be surprised at the answers you can find:   http://www.mormon.org   /

god/post_87:And why, precisely, it is on the person proposing the   existence   of an object. If you propose a pink elephant is floating above my head, it doesn't mean that you must therefore prove it. I can live my life as if there is a floating invisible pink elephant, or I can live my life as if there is no elephant. If you believe all believers in any deities require a change of behavior from the world, then you are mistaken.You originally defined athiest as "the denial that supernatural beings exist" and went on to posit that since most individuals profess to one single   religion   and deny all others, they are already atheists. This is inconsistent with your definition. Despite my disbelief in Zeus, or more accurately, my unwillingness to change my behavior to reflect the validity of the assumption that Zeus exists, I still may believe in other deities. Also, you're assuming that every   religious   person approaches their own belief with a lack of skepticism, uncritically and wholly. This is simply untrue. Look over this site and you'll see examples of people examining the ideas of   faith  , but still remaining faithful. From your last post, with the fear of eternal punishment reference, I believe you may have confused "Theist" with "Christian". Please do not equate "Belief in a God" with "Belief in Hell".

guns/post_386:By telling stories instead of concrete numbers, you ignore the larger picture. For every incident of a tragic fatality from a firearm, there are an equal, or greater number of incidences where lives are saved by firearms.To try to use an occasional story to legislate the majority is a disservice against all Americans. Review this story for basis:    http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/08/AR2008060800576.html    A Japanese man drove a large truck hitting pedestrians and then stabbing them. If we legislated on emotion and anecdotes, as the original poster would suggest, we would ban renting large cars and many types of knives.

guns/post_395:First off- thank you for your citation. Now that we are both looking at the same data I think we can be on the same page more. I hope you don't mind- but I went straight to the CDC website for the original data- I could not find 2005? anyway- all the stuff I'll be referencing will be 2004. I guess I couldn't find the 05 data on their site.first look at this- its a study by the CDC re: the effectiveness of Gun Laws (Including concealed carry)    http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5214a2.htm    all their research boils down to 'inconsistent results' continuing on with the CDC- less than 1% of all homicides and suicides of school age persons (age 10-24) occur in or on school grounds.also according to the CDC between 1992 and 2006, school homicide rate was on the decline, and school related homicides were perpetrated with a firearm 65 or so % of the time.    http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/YV_DataSheet.pdf    Obviously that data is missing VT, NIU, and some other major tragedies, but  the channel to purchase firearms legally is not where the 'violence problem' is coming from.I'll have to dig out the research- I think you can find it in 'gunfacts' (google gunfacts and you'll find a free webbook on it)but you mention assault rifles- prior to the brady bill they were used in less than 1.5% of crimes involving guns. 1.5% They have legitimate sporting and self defense purposes. I'm going to give you a quick sidebar here to help my point- as I don't mean to call you ignorant (I don't think you are) but I think firearms may be a bit foreign to you in their capabilities.Lets look at an AR-15 , the civilian version of the m16 that our soldiers carry. It is legal in many parts of the country, but not all- and fires 1 round per 1 trigger pull (that is semi-automatic)the most standard caliber is 223 remington, which has a military counterpart called 5.56x45- they aren't identical- but for the sake of this conversation we will assume they are- as a 5.56 gun can fire 223 without any issues.it fires a 55gr projectile around 3000 FPS. That sounds fast and powerful- but, did you know that the 55gr projectile going that fast will have less power to penetrate walls and homes than a many pistol rounds? its a function of physics- and again i'll try to find the data- I'm on my way to class right now and don't have time to run through all the numbers but maybe I can paint a picture for you anyway-a smaller  lighter projectile loses energy faster than a slower, heavier one. Its inertia. Like a semi going 35 miles an hour hitting a honda civic going 85. the semi still wins.so what is the point of all that? legislation, though often enacted with seemingly good intentions- is often done by people who have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. as me and you both seem very pro-civil liberties, I'd rather they not mess anything else up, and instead focus more on proven methods of crime prevention- like more police.of the handguns you reference- the vast majority are obtained ILLEGALLY- I see what your aiming for here- you want to choke off the supply and the problem will smother itself.Think of prohibition- we choked off the supply of alcohol, and what happened? it became so profitable to deal in it illegally that we gave rise to a massive crime syndicate in the US. The criminals still had booze, they still had guns, and now they had immense amounts of cash to finance whatever they needed.if you outlaw handguns and assault rifles the same thing will happen again. Good people will not have them, and criminals still will- because they exist outside the law. it'll become so profitable that a huge black market (a huger I should say- guns for crime are often dealt illegally anyway) where a situation is created where only criminals can get guns.Penn and Teller had a show called bullshit- or something to that effect, and they did a show on the effects of gun control. one of the things they did, was to go interview violent criminals in prison, and ask if any of the anti-gun laws in place choked supply of guns for them- the answer? no. alls it did was ensure that the people they intended to hurt (assuming not another criminal) was most likely unarmed.In my experience, many people who are anti-gun are so because they are not familiar with firearms and their actual capabilities. If we demystify what they are capable of, I think you, and many other people who feel the same way, will feel far more comfortable around them.

guns/post_401:I stand by original statement - criminals aren't _killed_ by private gun owners (or shot by them) at nearly the rate that victims and innocent people are.The "1.5m people use guns defensively every year" statistic is a tough one. I can find studies that refute that number and I'm sure you can find studies that show it's higher. The true number will probably never be known. It's like asking a car owner "what's the fastest you have driven in the last twelve months?" - many honest people will answer that incorrectly and passionate people may exaggerate the truth.I know it's hard to listen to the other side on an issue you passionately believe in, but I'm pretty sure no reasonable person believes James Brady is a brainwasher. Getting shot by some nutjob with no business possessing a weapon is a pretty good motivator to spread the word on this issue, but I think his namesake organization stops well short of brainwashing. I'm pretty sure he'd tell you that defensive gun stats don't make up for the fact that he's paralyzed and the President almost died (again) at the hands of a gun owner.Would you argue that the Constitution features a gun ownership right because of the deterrent effects on crime? Or the deterrent against a tyrannical government? I'd argue the latter. I don't trust most people I know, let alone the population at large, to brandish a firearm and have the ability to kill 6-9 people in under a minute if they decide they are a threat to them. The fact that so many innocent people get killed by guns each year, and in dramatically sad ways like mass public shootings, makes it particularly hard to justify the need for their easy possession or a calculation that there's a greater need to keep guns on the streets for crime prevention. Especially when guns enable crime - making their deterrent effect diminished. I think a gun owner should calculate that there's a pretty high chance anyone motivated enough to rob/attack them is armed. If you believe escalating a property crime to a homicide is the right response, I don't think you're in the same camp as most people.I do think killings would go down if we took most guns off the street. That's both criminals and victims dying. "General violence" as described above may go up, but if fewer people die isn't that still a net positive? I'm not aware of gun-control countries having significantly higher rates of violent crimes than the U.S. - I'm willing to eat my words if that's true.So I'm not here to argue for the rights of criminals. I'm here to argue for everyone's right to not be killed by a gun.

guns/post_42: Semi-automatic weapons do not serve a sporting purpose. Semi-automatic weapons original purpose are for shooting and killing humans, not game animals. In addition, is there any legitimate reason to want to involve assault weapons in the sport of hunting. First, the mass killing of game could be considered a violation of animal rights. At a minimum, this kind of activity does not seem to be much of a challenging sport. Rather, it would appear to make the maximization of the killing of game the primary objective, over the art of making a skillful kill.

guns/post_462:Kelly,I am ignorant? You dont even realize you are debating two different people. I never stated "The   second amendment   is not intended to defend American citizens from   hunger   or   crime  , but to protect them from the American government should that defense be required." that was the other persons statement not my own. So I never changed anything I simply added on to what was previously written BY SOMEONE ELSE. Since you took the stance that the 2nd Amendment was only for militias I wrote to counter that argument you put forth.  Which I completely agree, that was its original purpose and still very valid today. I also believe that like knives and hammers and any other tool a firearm is simply that a tool that can be used for good or bad. It is people who are evil not inanimate objects. Now you are moving completely over to the emotional side stating that the   murder   rate and death rate will increase with   firearms  . Can you back up this so called fact? Or did you just assume that is what would happen without again doing any research. How about you actually look up a few of the studies on Concealed Carry (I will leave a few at the end of this for you). Out of all the studies ever done on Concealed Carry in the US not one has shown an increase in crime or rates of death by firearms, not one. Not even the ones done by liberal slanted professors. I am not even going to bring up all the international studies which yet again show the same thing(that   guns   are not the problem) but in my opinion dont point to a clear stance all they prove is that different countries have different socio-cultural composites that tend to affect crime rates way more than the availability of firearms. But yet again you show your ignorance of   the law   and utter lack of proper research by bringing up the whole drinking while carrying rant. This is for you and everyone else out there that is attempting to hang on to this fallacy IT IS ILLEGAL!!! I will admit that a few states allow you to drink and carry but they are the overwhelming minority and have shown your argument to be false even when   legal  . I dont know any permit holder that would put their right to carry in jeopardy for a drink. Yes these people went through the training and background checks and paid the   money   to the state just to go have a beer and lose that right?  Yet again show me one instance where someone with a Concealed Carry Permit got drunk and did something stupid with their firearms. I do restrict this to people who have permits only and are not also   police   officers I found a few instances of officers being drunk with a gun and causing trouble but not an average citizen and officers are allowed to carry guns everywhere and are not seen as dangerous. I cant seem to find one and I currently live in Idaho for school, where it is legal to carry into a Bar and to a certain point drink while carrying (the law is fuzzy).  Its the same thing with the whole jealous rage ploy. It doesnt happen now so why would carrying onto a public park change that? Do we someone become different people in National Parks and we want to kill everything?? You are just regurgitating the same pathetic ranting that was brought up ten years ago when Concealed Carry Laws where first passed even after ten years there is still no basis to this argument. Do you really believe that if that ever did happen the news would be all over that, they would be eating that up. It would be plastered on every major news station how some idiot with a permit got drunk and shot up some place and he had a permit to carry the firearm legally. Also I ask that you leave out stories with people who happen to live in a state that requires you to have a permit to own a firearm (blatantly against the 2nd I might   add  )  it is not the same thing and does not give a person a right to carry only to own.I am glad you are thinking of buying a few weapons but I do suggest going to range for the proper training first so you dont become a danger to yourself and others like you assume everyone else to be. I also thoroughly resent your last statement I am neither an NRA member nor a criminal, you are stereotyping an entire group by the actions of a few which is a very narrow minded way to look at the world. Yet again I am placing my name at the bottom so you realize who you are debating with.LOUIS

guns/post_502:Hi LargerHead: I took ur   advice   and looked at 'pocket-pieces' I cud useand which wud fit in my shorts side pockets. The 2 reasons I originallypreferred either an M1 or M94 carbine were: 1. I can hit something far-ther away than with a handgun. 2. I have more chances to keep it/him from getting closer--10/15/30 chances!.. My 3 handgun choices are: 1.Walther PP/PPK German   police   mini-pistol [9mm/.380ACP or 7.65mm/.320ACP]7-8 rounds, each...2. Walther P38/P1/P4 German WW II Army replacement of'08 Lugar Parabellum and post-war Bundeswehr/Landespolizei [9mm/.380ACP]pistol from '57-late 90s...3. S&W 'Lady Smith compact, 5-shot [.38/9mm/.357Mag] FBI/policewomans' piece [easy to conceal/draw...Following uradvice, I wud practice both 'stand-n-extended arm' [match-position] and'crouch-n-point' [FBI/cop-position]. If I had two pistols [one in eachpocket, I cud 'trick-shoot' by firing one, then transferring to the ot-her for 10/13/16 shots--bound to git it/him at least once or twice?.. Iwud keep my trusty carbine nearby, too for 10/15/30 more shots..Aaron..

guns/post_636:I find it so absurd to think that we need to have 10 times more   guns   and rifles than the rest of the world!  Where did this fanaticism to own so many guns originally start?  Why do people need an AK-47 rifle or machine gun to go   hunting   for deer?  Its absurd!  The NRA is so far outside the mainstream now and cares nothing about being more reasonable and pragmatic!  They are so extreme in their thinking, that Pres George Herbert Walker Bush, a life-long member of the NRA, terminated his membership when they refused to agree to any sensible   gun control   measure including the Brady Bill!  We need to place strong controls on how many weapons can be manufactured and ration the number that anyone person can have!  Nobody needs more than 2 guns! Fines should be stiffened if not obeyed and if these fanatical gun owners don't like it who cares!  The government knows whats best for the American people when it comes to owning guns!

guns/post_652:The idea that "communities should be able to decide"--How far does that go, or does local rule only apply to the second amendment?  Was it interference of ideologically-driven outsiders when civil rights organizers came from halfway across the country to try to end racial segregation?  Does the city get to forbid a Muslim Mosque?  There is a pretty clear divide between lawful gun owners and criminals.  The ones that will be stopped by a law aren't the ones you need worry about--they will obey the existing laws against murder and assault.   The ones who will murder and assault aren't going to obey gun laws, either.  I keep seeing statements that the Brady Campaign and their associates won't violate the fundamental right to bear arms, but I have never seen a statement of what guns we would have left, if the Brady Campaign were completely successful.    I suspect .22 bolt-action rifles, .410 shotguns and not much else. All of the following have been proposed as "reasonable restrictions":The assault weapons ban covered guns that held too much ammo, or looked scary. It covered handguns that were too large and heavy.  It regulated bayonet mounts and the way the wood was carved.   It forbid handguns that were too large, or that held their magazines in front of the grip, or that were called "Uzi".   The Gun Control Act of 1967 covered imported Saturday Night Specials that working class people could afford.   Several localities have extended that restriction to domestically produced guns with the same features and design.  Guns .50 caliber and larger are "too powerful" and "used to bring down airplanes". A ban on "cop killer" bullets capable of penetrating police body armor.  Many people not familiar with the details would think that these are all reasonable restrictions.  However: The Glock models 17 and 22 are the standard full-sized handgun that many police departments issue. They are large enough that many departments issue the slightly smaller models 19 and 23 instead.  All of these guns, as carried by tens of thousands of policemen were covered by the now expired assault weapons ban--"too big" for civilians to carry unless you used special reduced capacity magazines.  Oddly, they are also covered by the 1967 law--Glock has to put click-adjustable sights on them to get enough "points" so they are not classified as a "Saturday Night Special" or "Junk Gun".   The click sighs are generally replaced by the original versions by the importer before sale.  If these guns are simultaneously too big and too small, what is left in between? The "cop killer" rules would ban ALL common rifle ammunition except .22 rimfire.  The standard body armor as worn by police is only meant to protect against handguns--in order to protect against rifle with current technology, the armor would need to be far bulkier than it is.   Some of the laws that are promoted as banning the .50BMG also cover revolutionary war flintlock muskets, and all common shotguns except the .410.  There is usually an exception for shotguns "particularly suitable for sporting purposes" as decided by some bureaucrat-- But we promise this won't be used to take *your* shotgun, honest. . Hollow point ammo is "so deadly it is forbidden to be used in warfare", and therefore not suitable.  Jacketed ammo is "too military".  To me, gun rights represent freedom and self-reliance rather than subservience.  They do not represent the right to use my gun to get my way--If I use a gun or the threat of one to win an argument, I should be prosecuted and go to jail.  I already have the power to take life.  The gun gives me the power to protect life and liberty.

guns/post_67: The Second Amendment confers the individual right to self defense   Modern legal scholarship  posits that the amendment is the affirmation of the the individual freedom to posses guns and use them for self protection.James Madison's original version of the amendment described the militia as comprised of people . This reflects the framer's intent to extend this freedom to every citizen as a right to self protection .The amendment reflects the philosophical foundation of the American societies built as counter hegemonic culture formed and perpetuated by the preservation of freedom.

guns/post_681:Never has an anti-gun organization proposed anything that could ever be misconstrued as 'reasonable'Spokeswoman and representative Sarah Brady pushed for the legislation of HR 1022 with the Law Enforcement protection act in 2007 without even knowing what some of the things she was trying to have banned do. This was most emphasized in her video here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rGpykAX1fo  She outright lied saying that the original assault weapons ban was a ban on weapons most used to kill our officers when in actuality the weapons banned turned up in less than 2% of all violent crimes involving guns.She also mentioned large capacity clips- which do not exist, but large capacity magazines do.but then when directly asked what barrel shrouds are, and their function, and after 3 unsuccessful dodges, she admitted she had no idea. How could we, the gun community ever expect anything reasonable to come from an organization which has representatives that do not even understand their own position and proposed legislation?Also Paul Helmke, president of the  Brady Campaign, is the same gentleman that started a fundraiser on their website the day after the Virginia Tech Massacre. He is a man of no moral compass who has used tragedy to further his personal agenda and line his own pockets.

guns/post_688:Adam-The reason we feel the Brady Campaign is pushing for total disarmament is this (forgive me I'm going to give a number of links and explanations):  http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/faqs/?page=sns  note the above first- the brady campaign seeker tighter regulation of the firearms industry with regards to safety. Outwardly it seems like a very reasonable policy, make safe tools for people to use safely. No one would be against such a thing.However, these regulations are already in place, things like transfer bar safeties, drop test requirements, and a variety of other safety features are included in all firearms of modern manufacture. the firearm described by the Brady campaign in that section, with shorter barrel lengths, is actually THE IDEAL handgun for self defense because they lend themselves to actually being carried. eliminating guns with barrel lengths under 3 in eliminates the compact auto and compact revolver market- driving several gun manufacturers completely out of business; despite the fact that their products are very accurate, safe, and useful.I'm not sure if I'm making my point clear, but they are not pushing for the elimination of junk guns, but the total elimination of a style of extremely useful defensive gun utilized heavily by private citizens.then lets look at the assault weapons ban  http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/faqs/?page=awb  besides a number of bans by name, the parameters for the ban eliminate a number of other guns as well. Handguns over 50 oz for instance eliminate a number of excellent hunting pistols (mine included) most importantly however, they ban a number of guns that really aren't used in crimes. In my original post some ways up the 1994 AWB stopped citizens from buying guns that were involved in less than 2% of gun related crimes. NONE of which are easily converted to full auto, despite what the Brady Campaign will say.They also put up wildly inaccurate information. if you look under assault rifles vs hunting rifles, where 'assault rifles are meant to be spray fired from the hip' that is a totally made up assessment. No 'assault rifle' (which for the most part are not available to citizens because a true assault rifle is fully automatic, so already they are dishonest with their naming) is intended to be used in such an inaccurate manner. Ask any military friend what happened if they tried to fire their m16 from the hip. I bet their Drill Instructor gave them a verbal berating they wouldn't soon forget.Also- the difference between a hunting rifle and a assault rifle by their definition, is the stock, magazine, and in some ways the barrel configuration. All of these are readily changeable parts on a firearm. This allows the Brady Campaign to ban hunting rifles just by saying they can be easily converted to assault rifles- allowing them to extend their ban to eliminate virtually all semi-automatic weapons.People can talk about legitimate sporting purposes all they want, but the fact is, I own a number of military style weapons, both rifles and handguns, and am completely safe. To limit my rights on strawman arguments against crimes that frankly have not occurred is a complete disservice to me as a citizen.  http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/faqs/?page=second  above note the dreaded 'gunshow' loophole.I'll be brief with this section as it is so fraught with error it is insulting to have listed such a thing as fact. To say that a full quarter of gunshow tables do not have gun licenses may be accurate, simply because there are easily that many tables at a gun show NOT selling guns of any sort.

guns/post_995: Ah, but you see, it is partially because of the Brits that we have the second amendment. The original framers of the constitution had developed a bit of distrust in government strong arm tactics due to certain disagreements with the British government and worked to limit government power in a number of ways. One of which was to insure our populations right to arm themselves.   /> Frankly I agree, and I think that history would support me on this. A government needs to be at least slightly afraid of what its people might do, or else they tend to collect more and more powers to themselves, and govern in such a way that has less and less to do with the wishes of the people.

healthcare/post_408:I agree with your point, but I think you missed the original point... the distinction between costs and spending.The original author suggested that Single-Payer systems spend less, not by more efficiency or lack of medical necessity but by political decree.  They cut corners and spend less by denying patients who need services and by reducing payments to doctors.  This doesn't mean they are making health care less costly -- they are just reducing how many of the costs they are willing to pay for.If you stop driving your car and instead walk to work then you are not making gas cost less you're only reducing how much you spend paying for it.

healthcare/post_428:Your right to life imposes nothing on your would-be murderer, but it imposes something on a third party: the taxpayer, who must fund the police that will arrest your would-be murderer and thus protect your right to life.Likewise, if you don't want a crook to steal your property, you must either (a) defend your property by yourself, using your own money and abilities, or (b) force taxpayers to give money to support a police force and court system that will defend your property.If (b), then your rights place a positive obligation on other people. If (a), then your rights only exist as long as you can defend yourself from violent attackers - so might makes right. There is no other choice. Either might makes right, or you must force other people to pay money for the protection of your rights.Of course the military and those in the justice system are not "forced" to act on your behalf - just like doctors would not be "forced" to act on your behalf in a universal health care system. I was merely using an analogy to point out that your original argument was absurd. The status of doctors in a universal health care system is exactly the same as the status of judges in the current justice system.As for Ayn Rand, she was a second-rate, incompetent philosopher who ignored any argument she didn't like. I suggest you read David Hume, who explains why you cannot derive an "ought" from an "is," (which is what Rand tries to do), as well as Jeremy Bentham, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Stuart Mill, Immanuel Kant and John Rawls. They all have different conceptions of rights and provide different arguments to support those views. The point is that the issue of "rights," and the question of which rights are legitimate, is an extremely long philosophical discussion that has occupied hundreds of books. It is unbelievably arrogant to claim that you have the final word on the matter.

healthcare/post_530:Nothing in my argument remotely construes universal healthcare is the cause of the expense of healthcare in the U.S.; however, as an aside argument, I think there is a connection that has yet to be made that the socialist healthcare systems of other countries are at least in part responsible for the costs of healthcare in the U.S.. Merck pharmaceutical sells its drugs to both private and public healthcare systems. Merck will be compensated for losses incurred by sales to public systems by passing the loss to private systems in the form of higher prices. So in a sense it is plausible that the public healthcare systems of the world actually exacerbate higher prices where healthcare is privately owned. Now back to our original subject. #1. What is the primary problem with the healthcare system of the U.S.? My answer: Ninety plus percent of the patients of the system cannot afford to pay the price of their own healthcare.#2. What is the root cause of the patients inability to pay for healthcare? Is it A, healthcare is too expensive or B, that their wages are too low, or C other.My answer: B, their wages are too low.(My father,uninsured, earning the wage of a garage mechanic, paid cash for the births of all of his children with less than four weekly paychecks each. Today, how many mechanics are paid 14,000 dollars a month, which is the average cost of an uncomplicated vaginal birth? )HEY! I am no longer going to continue debating or justifying my argument concerning U.H.Either people understand or dont understand what robbery looks like. I am not their god or their moral judge.Screw the logical formality of debating this absurd question! Universal Healthcare is a crime against the working class.  The question of this entire debate is nothing more than a question about the benefit of outright criminality.Indulge my short or not so short rant for a moment, if you will. I am extremely disturbed that in the hearts and minds of the U.S. populace, people abound in ignorance of the fact they advocate robbery when they push for public healthcare. They are implicating themselves as criminals and seek to justify their criminality by legislative action of the government. We are truly a nation of thieves. We, as a nation, are so mad upon our right to healthcare we want to violate the right of ownership of property, including the wages of all persons in the U.S. Its as though there is no other alternative but to steal from one another, our children, parents, and friends. And the justification for all of it is that all is right because everyone will be doing it. (Bare in mind that they who argue the most for public healthcare have the most to gain by it. There will be 80 million baby boomers entering retirement in the next eighteen years. Should we suppose they want someone else to pay for their healthcare so that they can take cruises around the world? (Have you seen the bumper sticker on the $300.000 RVs that read: I am spending my childrens inheritance)Moreover how many of those baby boomers want people such as myself and our families to pay for their healthcare needs for the next eighteen plus years? This is too much like social security with perks! )Know this; we will have in the U.S. within a very short time frame a public healthcare system. And how do I know this? The baby boom generation of 80+million rules the country today and before too many of them have retired they will make certain that their children are bound by taxation for the healthcare needs of the baby boom gen. And so in conclusion, regardless of what is thought or not thought of public healthcare we working class stiffs will be paying in the form of taxation all healthcare needs of the most debauched, rotten, spoiled generation ever born in the U.S. The baby boomers are currently socializing the losses of the most cherished institutions of the U.S.; expect the healthcare system over the coming weeks and months of this year to also need taxpayer money. Yes, Ive made a judgment of the baby boom gen. I know what to expect from that gen. and I am in no mood to prove they intend to rob from me and mine. The baby boom gen. fixes its problems by acts of governmental crimes against the innocent.

healthcare/post_561:Nothing in my argument remotely construes universal healthcare is the cause of the expense of healthcare in the U.S.; however, as an aside argument, I think there is a connection that has yet to be made that the socialist healthcare systems of other countries are at least in part responsible for the costs of healthcare in the U.S.. Merck pharmaceutical sells its drugs to both private and public healthcare systems. Merck will be compensated for losses incurred by sales to public systems by passing the loss to private systems in the form of higher prices. So in a sense it is plausible that the public healthcare systems of the world actually exacerbate higher prices where healthcare is privately owned. Now back to our original subject. #1. What is the primary problem with the healthcare system of the U.S.? My answer: Ninety plus percent of the patients of the system cannot afford to pay the price of their own healthcare.#2. What is the root cause of the patients inability to pay for healthcare? Is it A, healthcare is too expensive or B, that their wages are too low, or C other.My answer: B, their wages are too low.(My father, earning the wage of a garage mechanic, paid cash for the births of all of his children with less than four weekly paychecks each. Today, how many mechanics are paid 14,000 dollars a month, which is the average cost of an uncomplicated vaginal birth? )HEY! I am no longer going to continue debating or justifying my argument concerning U.H.Either people understand or dont understand what robbery looks like. I am not their god or their moral judge.Screw the logical formality of debating this absurd question! Universal Healthcare is a crime against the working class.  The question of this entire debate is nothing more than a question about the benefit of outright criminality.Indulge my short or not so short rant for a moment, if you will. I am extremely disturbed that in the hearts and minds of the U.S. populace, people abound in ignorance of the fact they advocate robbery when they push for public healthcare. They are implicating themselves as criminals and seek to justify their criminality by legislative action of the government. We are truly a nation of thieves. We, as a nation, are so mad upon our right to healthcare we want to violate the right of ownership of property, including the wages of all persons in the U.S. Its as though there is no other alternative but to steal from one another, our children, parents, and friends. And the justification for all of it is that all is right because everyone will be doing it. (Bare in mind that they who argue the most for public healthcare have the most to gain by it. There will be 80 million baby boomers entering retirement in the next eighteen years. Should we suppose they want someone else to pay for their healthcare so that they can take cruises around the world? (Have you seen the bumper sticker on the $300.000 RVs that read: I am spending my childrens inheritance)Moreover how many of those baby boomers want people such as myself and our families to pay for their healthcare needs for the next eighteen plus years? This is too much like social security with perks! )Know this; we will have in the U.S. within a very short time frame a public healthcare system. And how do I know this? The baby boom generation of 80+million rules the country today and before too many of them have retired they will make certain that their children are bound by taxation for the healthcare needs of the baby boom gen. And so in conclusion, regardless of what is thought or not thought of public healthcare we working class stiffs will be paying in the form of taxation all healthcare needs of the most debauched, rotten, spoiled generation ever born in the U.S. The baby boomers are currently socializing the losses of the most cherished institutions of the U.S.; expect the healthcare system over the coming weeks and months of this year to also need taxpayer money.

healthcare/post_566:Where are we going to get the doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, cardiologists, rheumatologists, CNA's, PCA's, and the like, not to mention room in the wards and equipment to care for there patients?Under my plan, we pattern a Universal Health Care, system after our Military. Our Military is socialism on a grand scale, and we have the Best Trained, Best Equipped Military in the World. So I used the same model in to model my Health Care Plan around.We recruit kids out of high school, that have good grades and a interest in the medical field, but because of financial reasons cannot afford to go to College. We get them to enlist in the Medical Corps, where we promise to pay for their entire Medical education, in exchange for a agreement of practicing in a Government Hospital somewhere in the United States for 10 years. At the end of the 10 years, they can either re-enlist or they can choose to go into private practice.Doctors and Nurses would be paid a competive salery but not as much as they possibly could be making in private paractice. However under the Government they do not have administrative costs, or Office exspenses, and no malpractice insurance premiums to worry about.The chances for malpractice would be reduced, do to the fact a person could get up to five different opinions if they were not comfortable with the original diagnosis. While this won't rule out malpractice 100% there will always be the doctor who makes a mistake. In which case the case would be reviewed and if found the Doctor was grossly negligent, would have his license to practice pulled.Most lawsuits today seek money to pay for future care of the patient, however that wouldn't be necessary, because you already have free medical.We could employ 500,000 doctors at a cost of 100 billion dollars wich would give us a Patient to Doctor Ratio of 600 to 1. Thats what are current ratio is. But the problem is there are communities who do not have any doctors, so they have to travel a great distance for care. This problem would be solved also under my plan.We buy up older hospitals to keep the cost down. We Do have strategically placed Expensive Diagnostic equipment within a 4 hours drive of any location. So it is possible that a person would have to drive up to 250 miles to get a MRI, but they would be able to deduct the cost of the trip on their taxes, excluding lodging. Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so. We currently will be paying $550 -$600 billion in interest on the debt next year. So if we can pay off the debt, which I can do in 7 years, and return this country to a lender nation, this country could afford to Universal Health care better than what France has, and I could still cut everyones taxes by $3800.00.Part of it would be paid for by interest money we would be collecting from other countries, once we became a lender nation again. By loaning Money to developing 3rd world countries we spread our influence over these countries by helping them develope, instead of China or Russia. The intrest we collect on the loans helps pay for our health care.This would lower medical costs, let consumers keep the money they currently pay out for insurance premiums and deductables, and reduce the cost for business who currently pay the lions share of a employees health care insurance. This should add another 3-4% onto our economic growth a year.Along with my trade reforms we could have 10% economic growth year over year. But remember we are fighting a entrenched insurance lobby, who will fight this type of plan tooth and nail. Not to mention business might even fight it because it would we would have economic freedom if we were to have 10% growth year over year in this country. They do not want workers who are empowered. They want workers wholive in fear of losing their jobs everyday.But it can be done, and I can pay for it without raising taxes.
